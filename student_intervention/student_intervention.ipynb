Support vector machines are used to solve classification problems in wide range of application domains such as text categorization and image classification (4,5). The general applications of Naive Bayes algorithm include \n",

    "Strengths of Decision tree: Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret due to their graphical representation. Since missing values and outliers do not influence decision trees, the use of decision tree algorithm does not require any prior data manipulation or cleaning. The decision tree algorithm does not require assuming linearity in the data and can be used \n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",

    "**Answer: ** I chose Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the best model based on the F1 scores computed for all three classifiers. The F1 scores (weighted average of precision and recall) computed for the SVM model for test datasets were maximum (~0.8). The decision tree model is generally the most appropriate for the dataset as it can easily handle feature interactions and we do not need to worry about missing values and outliers in the data and whether or not the data is linearly separable. Though SVM had better performance (based on F1 score) as compared to the decision tree model and naive bayes classifier, the outcome prediction time for the training dataset was lowest for the decision tree model as compared to other models. An increase in the number of features in the dataset is likely to further increase the prediction time and cost for the SVM model. Thus, in general, decision tree might be a preferred model."

    "Support vector machine model classifies data by finding the decision boundary or a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes within the data. Support vectors are the vectors that define the hyperplane. When the data is not linearly separable (by a straight line or an N-dimensional hyperplane), SVM uses a kernel function to map the low-dimensional input space to a higher dimensional space in order to find a linear separating hyperplane. As shown in the image below, projecting the decision boundary found in higher dimensional space back to the original low dimensional feature space will yield a nonlinear decision boundary.\n",

However, the final F1 score for the test set is approximately equal to the F1 score for the untuned model (~ 0.81)."
