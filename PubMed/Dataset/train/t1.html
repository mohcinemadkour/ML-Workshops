Various strategies are being explored in manufacturing DC vaccines ex vivo, e.g., monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated antigens (LAA). However, the optimal source of LAA and the choice of DC-activating stimuli are still not well defined. Here, loading with leukemic cell preparations (harboring both unknown and known LAA) was explored in combination with a DC maturation-inducing cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and PGE<sub>2</sub>) and Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) to optimize uptake. Since heat shock induced apoptotic blasts were more efficiently taken up than lysates, we focused on uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells. Uptake of apoptotic blast was further enhanced by the TLR7/8-L R848 (20&#x02013;30%); in contrast, CC-induced maturation inhibited uptake. CC, and to a lesser extent R848, enhanced the ability of MoDC to migrate and stimulate T cells. Furthermore, class II-associated invariant chain peptide expression was down-modulated after R848- or CC-induced maturation, indicating enhanced processing and presentation of antigenic peptides. To improve both uptake and maturation, leukemic cells and MoDC were co-incubated with R848 for 24&#x000a0;h followed by addition of CC. However, this approach interfered with CC-mediated MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migratory and T cell stimulatory capacity, and the absence of IL-12 production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that even though R848 improved uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells, the sequential use of R848 and CC is counter-indicated due to its adverse effects on MoDC maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cell vaccination</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of clonal neoplastic myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells and impaired normal hematopoiesis. Although 70&#x02013;80% of patients (&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;years) achieve complete remission after intensive chemotherapy, AML frequently relapses due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Escape of leukemic cells from immune surveillance has been associated with the poor clinical outcome. For instance, a high occupancy of HLA-DR molecules with the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) instead of an antigenic peptide is correlated with a shortened disease-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, immune control of leukemia, as shown for instance by the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or the reinduction of complete remission after donor lymphocyte infusion following allogeneic SCT, demonstrates the potential of exploiting the immune system in aid of anti-AML therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The induction, regulation, and maintenance of primary immune responses, including specific anti-tumor T cell responses are coordinated by dendritic cells (DC). Vaccination with DC has been recognized as a promising investigational therapy due to the uniquely powerful antigen (Ag)-presenting capacity of DC and its potential to circumvent immunosuppressive features of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first steps down the road to DC vaccination in AML have been taken and results from small clinical trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The general lack of clinical responses evoked important questions concerning the optimal methodologies for DC vaccine preparation as well as the design of clinical vaccination protocols. Many strategies are explored in the preparation of DC vaccines ex vivo; among these, autologous monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated Ag (LAA) are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Various sources of LAA and different methods of loading LAA onto DC have been explored in an attempt to optimize anti-tumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For AML, several relevant LAA have been identified including PRAME, RHAMM, WT1, and PR1. Unfortunately, overexpression of these LAA is common, but not uniform in leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, HLA restriction of LAA-derived peptides limits application of such vaccines to patients with certain HLA profiles. These restrictions inherent to the use of defined LAA or LAA-derived peptides may be overcome using the whole AML cells as a source of LAA, for instance by generation of AML lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells. Among other whole AML cell-derived antigen loading strategies that have been explored is electroporation of DC with AML-derived RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also vaccination with modified AML cells, such as AML-derived DC or fusions between AML cells and DC, has been investigated; further modification of DC with 4-1BB-L or CD40 might enhance the efficacy of such vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has long been assumed that the apoptotic cell death is poorly immunogenic or even tolerogenic, whereas necrotic cell death is considered to be immunogenic. However, stress-induced heat shock protein (HSP)-peptide complexes (commonly induced during apoptosis) are more efficiently taken up via scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the DC surface and induce efficient cross-priming and skewing of the immune response towards a Th1-type profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], whereas necrosis has been associated with the local immune suppression in solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, apoptosis induction after irradiation with UV light or by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs results in upregulation of calreticulin, a scavenger receptor class-A ligand associated with immunogenic apoptosis as demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For AML, it is not yet clear whether cell lysates or apoptotic cells are preferable for Ag loading onto MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Next to enhancing immunogenicity of tumor Ag sources by, for instance, heat shock, addition of DC-maturing stimuli, such as Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L), is explored; e.g., electroporation of TLR3-L Poly(I:C) into AML cells results in enhanced uptake of leukemic cells by DC and improves their subsequent maturation and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, intracellular binding of TLR8 by its ligand R848 has been reported to result in enhanced cross-priming of exogenous Ag by MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Various whole AML cell preparations loaded onto MoDC in combination with DC maturation-inducing cocktails have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, the quantitative effects of TLR-L and cytokines on uptake of leukemic cells are still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we compared the uptake of allogeneic apoptotic leukemic cells with lysates derived from leukemic cells. We investigated the uptake of heat shock-induced apoptotic leukemic cells by MoDC and DC maturation by combining a standard cytokine cocktail (CC) with the clinically applicable TLR7/8-L R848.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).

The percentage of necrotic, apoptotic, and viable cells was determined before and after apoptosis induction by incubation with Syto-62 (5&#x000a0;nM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), PSC833 (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; ViaProbe, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 45&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000b0;C, and by flow cytometric analysis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Syto-62 is a fluorescent nucleic acid stain that exhibits bright fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids and is retained in viable cells. Together with the dead-cell dye 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), discrimination between viable (Syto+/7AAD-) and early (Syto-/7AAD-) and late (Syto-/7AAD+) stages of apoptosis can be made. MoDC were labeled with CellVue Plum (Polysciences, Washington, CO) or with PKH26 (Sigma, Missouri, USA) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; guidelines.

Isotype controls used were FITC-labeled IgG1 (DAKO) and IgG2b (Sanquin), PE-labeled IgG1 (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (DAKO), and PerCP-labeled IgG1 and IgG2a (Becton Dickinson). For HLA-DO and HLA-DM, the following mouse mAb were used: HLA-DM (Becton Dickinson) and IgG1 isotype control (Becton Dickinson); FITC-labeled HLA-DO (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (Becton Dickinson).

Of note, IL-12p70 release was almost completely abolished by the combined sequential use of R848 and CC [mean relative decrease 0.97 (&#x000b1;0.06)]. However, incubation with R848 and CC increased the ability of MoDC to prime na&#x000ef;ve T cells in an allogeneic MLR in accordance with the observations for phenotypic maturation: addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h pre-incubation with R848 enhanced T cell stimulating capacity, but not to the same level as seen for CC alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was undertaken to investigate the various MoDC vaccine preparation strategies in order to create an optimized MoDC vaccine for the treatment of MRD in AML. The ability of HD-derived MoDC to take up whole cell-derived material in combination with TLR-L was investigated in order to enhance the uptake of LAA. Furthermore, we explored the capability of MoDC to mature under the influence of various TLR-L and a standard CC as positive control.</p><p>Immature DC are capable of taking up Ag, e.g., from infected cells or tumor cells, in the form of apoptotic bodies or necrotic cell particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Next to the Ag source, agents such as TLR-L or cytokines can affect the outcome of this uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Upon encounter with for instance microbial agents or other inflammatory stimuli, DC mature from cells specialized in Ag uptake into cells specialized in T cell stimulation. Inflammatory cytokines are considered as strong maturation inducers but, as we demonstrated, CC inhibits further Ag uptake by DC. In contrast, TLR-L are known to enhance the uptake of antigenic material and subsequently induce maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In accordance with this, we found the enhanced uptake after co-incubation with TLR- L R848, whereas addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h of co-incubation with R848 halted further uptake.</p><p>The method by which leukemic cell death was induced influenced the amount of cellular material taken up by MoDC: less uptake was achieved in DC after co-incubation with lysate as compared to apoptotic cells. In the process of dying, apoptotic cells are known to shed immunogenic particles, i.e., so-called blebs. Murine studies have demonstrated that these blebs are taken up more efficiently by DC than the remaining, larger, apoptotic bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This may offer an explanation for our observation that the apoptotic AML cells are more efficiently taken up by MoDC than AML lysates. Additional knowledge about the ability of DC to prime LAA-specific T cells is clearly warranted to further differentiate between both whole leukemic cell-derived antigen sources.</p><p>One of the key players in the MHC class II presentation pathway is CLIP and its regulators HLA-DM and HLA-DO. TLR-L regulate processing of the invariant chain (Ii) and influence the exchange of CLIP with antigenic peptides. TLR signaling is necessary to direct the internalized antigens via the classical pathway for presentation by MHC II, whereas tolerogenic DC can upregulate CLIP expression and hamper T cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consistent with this, CLIP expression was decreased when DC and apoptotic AML cells were co-incubated in the presence of R848 and/or CC, indicative of a putative increase in LAA presentation by the loaded MoDC.</p><p>Maturation of DC is necessary to enable migration to lymph nodes and activation of T cells. Consistent with literature, CC induced upregulation of CD86, expression of CD83, CCR7, and hence enhanced migratory capacity, the latter most likely due to the presence of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the cocktail. R848 is able to induce phenotypic maturation, but far less prominently than CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this setting, our results indicate that R848 is rather an enhancer of antigen uptake than a straightforward maturation inducer, whereas CC only promotes maturation. We hypothesized that both high uptake and maturation might be achieved by combining prolonged R848 incubation (24&#x000a0;h) followed by the addition of CC. However, maturation was only slightly increased compared to R848 alone. These data indicate that TLR-L antagonize the maturation efficacy of CC. Recent studies showed the inhibitory effects of TLR-L LPS and Poly(I:C) on DC by the activation of so-called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). It has been described that SOCS1, 2, and 3 are required for appropriate TLR signaling in maturing human DC via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By first enhancing uptake with TLR-L, the DC might become resistant to cytokines due to the activation of SOCS1/2, resulting in disturbed maturation. Moreover, TLR-mediated induction of maturation-inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) might be responsible for this maturation inhibitory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We did the attempt inhibition of putatively involved down-stream signaling elements (a.o. p38 MAPK, PI3&#x000a0;K, STAT3) to abolish this R848-mediated block in CC-induced DC maturation, but to no avail.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub>, part of the cytokine cocktail, is known to impair production of IL-12p70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As a consequence of reduced IL-12p70 levels, immunosuppressive cells, such as T regulatory cells might be recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Various combinations of cytokines and other DC-maturing factors, such as TLR-L, direct MoDC maturation towards a migratory and/or Th1-activating cytokine release profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that the simultaneous addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TLR 3/7/8 ligands resulted in higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules on DC as well as IL-12p70 production and migration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We hypothesized that by pre-incubating MoDC with R848, followed by maturation with CC (containing PGE<sub>2</sub>), both effective IL-12p70 production, migratory capacity as well as improved AML cell uptake might be established. Addition of CC after prolonged incubation with R848 enhanced the migratory capacity, but not to the same levels as CC alone. Furthermore, IL-12p70 production was abolished as compared to CC stimulation alone. This might be explained by the longer incubation time and, thereby exhaustion of MoDC before measuring the overnight IL-12p70 production. However, in a mixed leukocyte reaction, we demonstrated that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulatory capacity of R848 and/or CC matured MoDC was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that irrespective of IL-12p70 production, R848 and/or CC matured DC is able to stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since IL-12p70 is an important cytokine in Th1 and CTL activation, careful analysis of the ability to prime functional leukemia-specific T cells is needed to design optimal MoDC vaccine preparation strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the uptake of leukemic cells by MoDC and their maturation state is differentially affected by TLR-L R848 and CC. As compared to CC alone, the sequential use of R848 and CC interfered with the effective MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migration and T cell stimulatory capacity, and abolished IL-12p70 production. These findings do not justify incorporation of TLR7/8-L in DC-maturing cocktails for clinical development of whole-cell AML-loaded MoDC vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dinja Oosterhoff for technical advice and assistance.

Various strategies are being explored in manufacturing DC vaccines ex vivo, e.g., monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated antigens (LAA). However, the optimal source of LAA and the choice of DC-activating stimuli are still not well defined. Here, loading with leukemic cell preparations (harboring both unknown and known LAA) was explored in combination with a DC maturation-inducing cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and PGE<sub>2</sub>) and Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) to optimize uptake. Since heat shock induced apoptotic blasts were more efficiently taken up than lysates, we focused on uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells. Uptake of apoptotic blast was further enhanced by the TLR7/8-L R848 (20&#x02013;30%); in contrast, CC-induced maturation inhibited uptake. CC, and to a lesser extent R848, enhanced the ability of MoDC to migrate and stimulate T cells. Furthermore, class II-associated invariant chain peptide expression was down-modulated after R848- or CC-induced maturation, indicating enhanced processing and presentation of antigenic peptides. To improve both uptake and maturation, leukemic cells and MoDC were co-incubated with R848 for 24&#x000a0;h followed by addition of CC. However, this approach interfered with CC-mediated MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migratory and T cell stimulatory capacity, and the absence of IL-12 production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that even though R848 improved uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells, the sequential use of R848 and CC is counter-indicated due to its adverse effects on MoDC maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cell vaccination</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of clonal neoplastic myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells and impaired normal hematopoiesis. Although 70&#x02013;80% of patients (&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;years) achieve complete remission after intensive chemotherapy, AML frequently relapses due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Escape of leukemic cells from immune surveillance has been associated with the poor clinical outcome. For instance, a high occupancy of HLA-DR molecules with the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) instead of an antigenic peptide is correlated with a shortened disease-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, immune control of leukemia, as shown for instance by the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or the reinduction of complete remission after donor lymphocyte infusion following allogeneic SCT, demonstrates the potential of exploiting the immune system in aid of anti-AML therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The induction, regulation, and maintenance of primary immune responses, including specific anti-tumor T cell responses are coordinated by dendritic cells (DC). Vaccination with DC has been recognized as a promising investigational therapy due to the uniquely powerful antigen (Ag)-presenting capacity of DC and its potential to circumvent immunosuppressive features of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first steps down the road to DC vaccination in AML have been taken and results from small clinical trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The general lack of clinical responses evoked important questions concerning the optimal methodologies for DC vaccine preparation as well as the design of clinical vaccination protocols. Many strategies are explored in the preparation of DC vaccines ex vivo; among these, autologous monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated Ag (LAA) are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Various sources of LAA and different methods of loading LAA onto DC have been explored in an attempt to optimize anti-tumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For AML, several relevant LAA have been identified including PRAME, RHAMM, WT1, and PR1. Unfortunately, overexpression of these LAA is common, but not uniform in leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, HLA restriction of LAA-derived peptides limits application of such vaccines to patients with certain HLA profiles. These restrictions inherent to the use of defined LAA or LAA-derived peptides may be overcome using the whole AML cells as a source of LAA, for instance by generation of AML lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells. Among other whole AML cell-derived antigen loading strategies that have been explored is electroporation of DC with AML-derived RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also vaccination with modified AML cells, such as AML-derived DC or fusions between AML cells and DC, has been investigated; further modification of DC with 4-1BB-L or CD40 might enhance the efficacy of such vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has long been assumed that the apoptotic cell death is poorly immunogenic or even tolerogenic, whereas necrotic cell death is considered to be immunogenic. However, stress-induced heat shock protein (HSP)-peptide complexes (commonly induced during apoptosis) are more efficiently taken up via scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the DC surface and induce efficient cross-priming and skewing of the immune response towards a Th1-type profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], whereas necrosis has been associated with the local immune suppression in solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, apoptosis induction after irradiation with UV light or by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs results in upregulation of calreticulin, a scavenger receptor class-A ligand associated with immunogenic apoptosis as demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For AML, it is not yet clear whether cell lysates or apoptotic cells are preferable for Ag loading onto MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Next to enhancing immunogenicity of tumor Ag sources by, for instance, heat shock, addition of DC-maturing stimuli, such as Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L), is explored; e.g., electroporation of TLR3-L Poly(I:C) into AML cells results in enhanced uptake of leukemic cells by DC and improves their subsequent maturation and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, intracellular binding of TLR8 by its ligand R848 has been reported to result in enhanced cross-priming of exogenous Ag by MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Various whole AML cell preparations loaded onto MoDC in combination with DC maturation-inducing cocktails have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, the quantitative effects of TLR-L and cytokines on uptake of leukemic cells are still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we compared the uptake of allogeneic apoptotic leukemic cells with lysates derived from leukemic cells. We investigated the uptake of heat shock-induced apoptotic leukemic cells by MoDC and DC maturation by combining a standard cytokine cocktail (CC) with the clinically applicable TLR7/8-L R848.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).

Isotype controls used were FITC-labeled IgG1 (DAKO) and IgG2b (Sanquin), PE-labeled IgG1 (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (DAKO), and PerCP-labeled IgG1 and IgG2a (Becton Dickinson). For HLA-DO and HLA-DM, the following mouse mAb were used: HLA-DM (Becton Dickinson) and IgG1 isotype control (Becton Dickinson); FITC-labeled HLA-DO (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (Becton Dickinson). Cells were stained for DO and DM after fixation with paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with PBS&#x02013;0.1% Saponine (Sigma-Aldrich).

The ability of HD-derived MoDC to take up whole cell-derived material in combination with TLR-L was investigated in order to enhance the uptake of LAA. Furthermore, we explored the capability of MoDC to mature under the influence of various TLR-L and a standard CC as positive control.</p><p>Immature DC are capable of taking up Ag, e.g., from infected cells or tumor cells, in the form of apoptotic bodies or necrotic cell particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Next to the Ag source, agents such as TLR-L or cytokines can affect the outcome of this uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Upon encounter with for instance microbial agents or other inflammatory stimuli, DC mature from cells specialized in Ag uptake into cells specialized in T cell stimulation. Inflammatory cytokines are considered as strong maturation inducers but, as we demonstrated, CC inhibits further Ag uptake by DC. In contrast, TLR-L are known to enhance the uptake of antigenic material and subsequently induce maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In accordance with this, we found the enhanced uptake after co-incubation with TLR- L R848, whereas addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h of co-incubation with R848 halted further uptake.</p><p>The method by which leukemic cell death was induced influenced the amount of cellular material taken up by MoDC: less uptake was achieved in DC after co-incubation with lysate as compared to apoptotic cells. In the process of dying, apoptotic cells are known to shed immunogenic particles, i.e., so-called blebs. Murine studies have demonstrated that these blebs are taken up more efficiently by DC than the remaining, larger, apoptotic bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This may offer an explanation for our observation that the apoptotic AML cells are more efficiently taken up by MoDC than AML lysates. Additional knowledge about the ability of DC to prime LAA-specific T cells is clearly warranted to further differentiate between both whole leukemic cell-derived antigen sources.</p><p>One of the key players in the MHC class II presentation pathway is CLIP and its regulators HLA-DM and HLA-DO. TLR-L regulate processing of the invariant chain (Ii) and influence the exchange of CLIP with antigenic peptides. TLR signaling is necessary to direct the internalized antigens via the classical pathway for presentation by MHC II, whereas tolerogenic DC can upregulate CLIP expression and hamper T cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consistent with this, CLIP expression was decreased when DC and apoptotic AML cells were co-incubated in the presence of R848 and/or CC, indicative of a putative increase in LAA presentation by the loaded MoDC.</p><p>Maturation of DC is necessary to enable migration to lymph nodes and activation of T cells. Consistent with literature, CC induced upregulation of CD86, expression of CD83, CCR7, and hence enhanced migratory capacity, the latter most likely due to the presence of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the cocktail. R848 is able to induce phenotypic maturation, but far less prominently than CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this setting, our results indicate that R848 is rather an enhancer of antigen uptake than a straightforward maturation inducer, whereas CC only promotes maturation. We hypothesized that both high uptake and maturation might be achieved by combining prolonged R848 incubation (24&#x000a0;h) followed by the addition of CC. However, maturation was only slightly increased compared to R848 alone. These data indicate that TLR-L antagonize the maturation efficacy of CC. Recent studies showed the inhibitory effects of TLR-L LPS and Poly(I:C) on DC by the activation of so-called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). It has been described that SOCS1, 2, and 3 are required for appropriate TLR signaling in maturing human DC via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By first enhancing uptake with TLR-L, the DC might become resistant to cytokines due to the activation of SOCS1/2, resulting in disturbed maturation. Moreover, TLR-mediated induction of maturation-inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) might be responsible for this maturation inhibitory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We did the attempt inhibition of putatively involved down-stream signaling elements (a.o. p38 MAPK, PI3&#x000a0;K, STAT3) to abolish this R848-mediated block in CC-induced DC maturation, but to no avail.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub>, part of the cytokine cocktail, is known to impair production of IL-12p70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As a consequence of reduced IL-12p70 levels, immunosuppressive cells, such as T regulatory cells might be recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Various combinations of cytokines and other DC-maturing factors, such as TLR-L, direct MoDC maturation towards a migratory and/or Th1-activating cytokine release profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that the simultaneous addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TLR 3/7/8 ligands resulted in higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules on DC as well as IL-12p70 production and migration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We hypothesized that by pre-incubating MoDC with R848, followed by maturation with CC (containing PGE<sub>2</sub>), both effective IL-12p70 production, migratory capacity as well as improved AML cell uptake might be established. Addition of CC after prolonged incubation with R848 enhanced the migratory capacity, but not to the same levels as CC alone. Furthermore, IL-12p70 production was abolished as compared to CC stimulation alone. This might be explained by the longer incubation time and, thereby exhaustion of MoDC before measuring the overnight IL-12p70 production. However, in a mixed leukocyte reaction, we demonstrated that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulatory capacity of R848 and/or CC matured MoDC was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that irrespective of IL-12p70 production, R848 and/or CC matured DC is able to stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since IL-12p70 is an important cytokine in Th1 and CTL activation, careful analysis of the ability to prime functional leukemia-specific T cells is needed to design optimal MoDC vaccine preparation strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the uptake of leukemic cells by MoDC and their maturation state is differentially affected by TLR-L R848 and CC. As compared to CC alone, the sequential use of R848 and CC interfered with the effective MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migration and T cell stimulatory capacity, and abolished IL-12p70 production. These findings do not justify incorporation of TLR7/8-L in DC-maturing cocktails for clinical development of whole-cell AML-loaded MoDC vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dinja Oosterhoff for technical advice and assistance.

Various strategies are being explored in manufacturing DC vaccines ex vivo, e.g., monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated antigens (LAA). However, the optimal source of LAA and the choice of DC-activating stimuli are still not well defined. Here, loading with leukemic cell preparations (harboring both unknown and known LAA) was explored in combination with a DC maturation-inducing cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and PGE<sub>2</sub>) and Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) to optimize uptake. Since heat shock induced apoptotic blasts were more efficiently taken up than lysates, we focused on uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells. Uptake of apoptotic blast was further enhanced by the TLR7/8-L R848 (20&#x02013;30%); in contrast, CC-induced maturation inhibited uptake. CC, and to a lesser extent R848, enhanced the ability of MoDC to migrate and stimulate T cells. Furthermore, class II-associated invariant chain peptide expression was down-modulated after R848- or CC-induced maturation, indicating enhanced processing and presentation of antigenic peptides. To improve both uptake and maturation, leukemic cells and MoDC were co-incubated with R848 for 24&#x000a0;h followed by addition of CC. However, this approach interfered with CC-mediated MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migratory and T cell stimulatory capacity, and the absence of IL-12 production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that even though R848 improved uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells, the sequential use of R848 and CC is counter-indicated due to its adverse effects on MoDC maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cell vaccination</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of clonal neoplastic myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells and impaired normal hematopoiesis. Although 70&#x02013;80% of patients (&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;years) achieve complete remission after intensive chemotherapy, AML frequently relapses due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Escape of leukemic cells from immune surveillance has been associated with the poor clinical outcome. For instance, a high occupancy of HLA-DR molecules with the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) instead of an antigenic peptide is correlated with a shortened disease-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, immune control of leukemia, as shown for instance by the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or the reinduction of complete remission after donor lymphocyte infusion following allogeneic SCT, demonstrates the potential of exploiting the immune system in aid of anti-AML therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The induction, regulation, and maintenance of primary immune responses, including specific anti-tumor T cell responses are coordinated by dendritic cells (DC). Vaccination with DC has been recognized as a promising investigational therapy due to the uniquely powerful antigen (Ag)-presenting capacity of DC and its potential to circumvent immunosuppressive features of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first steps down the road to DC vaccination in AML have been taken and results from small clinical trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The general lack of clinical responses evoked important questions concerning the optimal methodologies for DC vaccine preparation as well as the design of clinical vaccination protocols. Many strategies are explored in the preparation of DC vaccines ex vivo; among these, autologous monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated Ag (LAA) are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Various sources of LAA and different methods of loading LAA onto DC have been explored in an attempt to optimize anti-tumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For AML, several relevant LAA have been identified including PRAME, RHAMM, WT1, and PR1. Unfortunately, overexpression of these LAA is common, but not uniform in leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, HLA restriction of LAA-derived peptides limits application of such vaccines to patients with certain HLA profiles. These restrictions inherent to the use of defined LAA or LAA-derived peptides may be overcome using the whole AML cells as a source of LAA, for instance by generation of AML lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells. Among other whole AML cell-derived antigen loading strategies that have been explored is electroporation of DC with AML-derived RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also vaccination with modified AML cells, such as AML-derived DC or fusions between AML cells and DC, has been investigated; further modification of DC with 4-1BB-L or CD40 might enhance the efficacy of such vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has long been assumed that the apoptotic cell death is poorly immunogenic or even tolerogenic, whereas necrotic cell death is considered to be immunogenic. However, stress-induced heat shock protein (HSP)-peptide complexes (commonly induced during apoptosis) are more efficiently taken up via scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the DC surface and induce efficient cross-priming and skewing of the immune response towards a Th1-type profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], whereas necrosis has been associated with the local immune suppression in solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Inflammatory cytokines are considered as strong maturation inducers but, as we demonstrated, CC inhibits further Ag uptake by DC. In contrast, TLR-L are known to enhance the uptake of antigenic material and subsequently induce maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In accordance with this, we found the enhanced uptake after co-incubation with TLR- L R848, whereas addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h of co-incubation with R848 halted further uptake.</p><p>The method by which leukemic cell death was induced influenced the amount of cellular material taken up by MoDC: less uptake was achieved in DC after co-incubation with lysate as compared to apoptotic cells. In the process of dying, apoptotic cells are known to shed immunogenic particles, i.e., so-called blebs. Murine studies have demonstrated that these blebs are taken up more efficiently by DC than the remaining, larger, apoptotic bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This may offer an explanation for our observation that the apoptotic AML cells are more efficiently taken up by MoDC than AML lysates. Additional knowledge about the ability of DC to prime LAA-specific T cells is clearly warranted to further differentiate between both whole leukemic cell-derived antigen sources.</p><p>One of the key players in the MHC class II presentation pathway is CLIP and its regulators HLA-DM and HLA-DO. TLR-L regulate processing of the invariant chain (Ii) and influence the exchange of CLIP with antigenic peptides. TLR signaling is necessary to direct the internalized antigens via the classical pathway for presentation by MHC II, whereas tolerogenic DC can upregulate CLIP expression and hamper T cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consistent with this, CLIP expression was decreased when DC and apoptotic AML cells were co-incubated in the presence of R848 and/or CC, indicative of a putative increase in LAA presentation by the loaded MoDC.</p><p>Maturation of DC is necessary to enable migration to lymph nodes and activation of T cells. Consistent with literature, CC induced upregulation of CD86, expression of CD83, CCR7, and hence enhanced migratory capacity, the latter most likely due to the presence of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the cocktail. R848 is able to induce phenotypic maturation, but far less prominently than CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this setting, our results indicate that R848 is rather an enhancer of antigen uptake than a straightforward maturation inducer, whereas CC only promotes maturation. We hypothesized that both high uptake and maturation might be achieved by combining prolonged R848 incubation (24&#x000a0;h) followed by the addition of CC. However, maturation was only slightly increased compared to R848 alone. These data indicate that TLR-L antagonize the maturation efficacy of CC. Recent studies showed the inhibitory effects of TLR-L LPS and Poly(I:C) on DC by the activation of so-called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). It has been described that SOCS1, 2, and 3 are required for appropriate TLR signaling in maturing human DC via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By first enhancing uptake with TLR-L, the DC might become resistant to cytokines due to the activation of SOCS1/2, resulting in disturbed maturation. Moreover, TLR-mediated induction of maturation-inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) might be responsible for this maturation inhibitory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We did the attempt inhibition of putatively involved down-stream signaling elements (a.o. p38 MAPK, PI3&#x000a0;K, STAT3) to abolish this R848-mediated block in CC-induced DC maturation, but to no avail.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub>, part of the cytokine cocktail, is known to impair production of IL-12p70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As a consequence of reduced IL-12p70 levels, immunosuppressive cells, such as T regulatory cells might be recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Various combinations of cytokines and other DC-maturing factors, such as TLR-L, direct MoDC maturation towards a migratory and/or Th1-activating cytokine release profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that the simultaneous addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TLR 3/7/8 ligands resulted in higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules on DC as well as IL-12p70 production and migration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We hypothesized that by pre-incubating MoDC with R848, followed by maturation with CC (containing PGE<sub>2</sub>), both effective IL-12p70 production, migratory capacity as well as improved AML cell uptake might be established. Addition of CC after prolonged incubation with R848 enhanced the migratory capacity, but not to the same levels as CC alone. Furthermore, IL-12p70 production was abolished as compared to CC stimulation alone. This might be explained by the longer incubation time and, thereby exhaustion of MoDC before measuring the overnight IL-12p70 production. However, in a mixed leukocyte reaction, we demonstrated that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulatory capacity of R848 and/or CC matured MoDC was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that irrespective of IL-12p70 production, R848 and/or CC matured DC is able to stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since IL-12p70 is an important cytokine in Th1 and CTL activation, careful analysis of the ability to prime functional leukemia-specific T cells is needed to design optimal MoDC vaccine preparation strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the uptake of leukemic cells by MoDC and their maturation state is differentially affected by TLR-L R848 and CC. As compared to CC alone, the sequential use of R848 and CC interfered with the effective MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migration and T cell stimulatory capacity, and abolished IL-12p70 production. These findings do not justify incorporation of TLR7/8-L in DC-maturing cocktails for clinical development of whole-cell AML-loaded MoDC vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dinja Oosterhoff for technical advice and assistance.

Various strategies are being explored in manufacturing DC vaccines ex vivo, e.g., monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated antigens (LAA). However, the optimal source of LAA and the choice of DC-activating stimuli are still not well defined. Here, loading with leukemic cell preparations (harboring both unknown and known LAA) was explored in combination with a DC maturation-inducing cytokine cocktail (CC; IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and PGE<sub>2</sub>) and Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) to optimize uptake. Since heat shock induced apoptotic blasts were more efficiently taken up than lysates, we focused on uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells. Uptake of apoptotic blast was further enhanced by the TLR7/8-L R848 (20&#x02013;30%); in contrast, CC-induced maturation inhibited uptake. CC, and to a lesser extent R848, enhanced the ability of MoDC to migrate and stimulate T cells. Furthermore, class II-associated invariant chain peptide expression was down-modulated after R848- or CC-induced maturation, indicating enhanced processing and presentation of antigenic peptides. To improve both uptake and maturation, leukemic cells and MoDC were co-incubated with R848 for 24&#x000a0;h followed by addition of CC. However, this approach interfered with CC-mediated MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migratory and T cell stimulatory capacity, and the absence of IL-12 production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that even though R848 improved uptake of apoptotic leukemic cells, the sequential use of R848 and CC is counter-indicated due to its adverse effects on MoDC maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cell vaccination</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of clonal neoplastic myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells and impaired normal hematopoiesis. Although 70&#x02013;80% of patients (&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;years) achieve complete remission after intensive chemotherapy, AML frequently relapses due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Escape of leukemic cells from immune surveillance has been associated with the poor clinical outcome. For instance, a high occupancy of HLA-DR molecules with the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) instead of an antigenic peptide is correlated with a shortened disease-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, immune control of leukemia, as shown for instance by the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or the reinduction of complete remission after donor lymphocyte infusion following allogeneic SCT, demonstrates the potential of exploiting the immune system in aid of anti-AML therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The induction, regulation, and maintenance of primary immune responses, including specific anti-tumor T cell responses are coordinated by dendritic cells (DC). Vaccination with DC has been recognized as a promising investigational therapy due to the uniquely powerful antigen (Ag)-presenting capacity of DC and its potential to circumvent immunosuppressive features of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The first steps down the road to DC vaccination in AML have been taken and results from small clinical trials have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The general lack of clinical responses evoked important questions concerning the optimal methodologies for DC vaccine preparation as well as the design of clinical vaccination protocols. Many strategies are explored in the preparation of DC vaccines ex vivo; among these, autologous monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) loaded with leukemia-associated Ag (LAA) are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Various sources of LAA and different methods of loading LAA onto DC have been explored in an attempt to optimize anti-tumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For AML, several relevant LAA have been identified including PRAME, RHAMM, WT1, and PR1. Unfortunately, overexpression of these LAA is common, but not uniform in leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, HLA restriction of LAA-derived peptides limits application of such vaccines to patients with certain HLA profiles. These restrictions inherent to the use of defined LAA or LAA-derived peptides may be overcome using the whole AML cells as a source of LAA, for instance by generation of AML lysates or apoptotic leukemic cells. Among other whole AML cell-derived antigen loading strategies that have been explored is electroporation of DC with AML-derived RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also vaccination with modified AML cells, such as AML-derived DC or fusions between AML cells and DC, has been investigated; further modification of DC with 4-1BB-L or CD40 might enhance the efficacy of such vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has long been assumed that the apoptotic cell death is poorly immunogenic or even tolerogenic, whereas necrotic cell death is considered to be immunogenic. However, stress-induced heat shock protein (HSP)-peptide complexes (commonly induced during apoptosis) are more efficiently taken up via scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the DC surface and induce efficient cross-priming and skewing of the immune response towards a Th1-type profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], whereas necrosis has been associated with the local immune suppression in solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, apoptosis induction after irradiation with UV light or by treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs results in upregulation of calreticulin, a scavenger receptor class-A ligand associated with immunogenic apoptosis as demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For AML, it is not yet clear whether cell lysates or apoptotic cells are preferable for Ag loading onto MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Next to enhancing immunogenicity of tumor Ag sources by, for instance, heat shock, addition of DC-maturing stimuli, such as Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L), is explored; e.g., electroporation of TLR3-L Poly(I:C) into AML cells results in enhanced uptake of leukemic cells by DC and improves their subsequent maturation and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, intracellular binding of TLR8 by its ligand R848 has been reported to result in enhanced cross-priming of exogenous Ag by MoDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Various whole AML cell preparations loaded onto MoDC in combination with DC maturation-inducing cocktails have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; however, the quantitative effects of TLR-L and cytokines on uptake of leukemic cells are still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we compared the uptake of allogeneic apoptotic leukemic cells with lysates derived from leukemic cells. We investigated the uptake of heat shock-induced apoptotic leukemic cells by MoDC and DC maturation by combining a standard cytokine cocktail (CC) with the clinically applicable TLR7/8-L R848.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).

Leukemic cells were harvested and taken up in PBS and apoptosis was induced by heat shock (2&#x000a0;h at 42&#x000b0;C) or by incubation for 2&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C with ARA-C (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml; Mayne Pharma, Warwickshire, UK). The percentage of necrotic, apoptotic, and viable cells was determined before and after apoptosis induction by incubation with Syto-62 (5&#x000a0;nM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), PSC833 (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; ViaProbe, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 45&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000b0;C, and by flow cytometric analysis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Syto-62 is a fluorescent nucleic acid stain that exhibits bright fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids and is retained in viable cells. Together with the dead-cell dye 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), discrimination between viable (Syto+/7AAD-) and early (Syto-/7AAD-) and late (Syto-/7AAD+) stages of apoptosis can be made. MoDC were labeled with CellVue Plum (Polysciences, Washington, CO) or with PKH26 (Sigma, Missouri, USA) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; guidelines.

Isotype controls used were FITC-labeled IgG1 (DAKO) and IgG2b (Sanquin), PE-labeled IgG1 (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (DAKO), and PerCP-labeled IgG1 and IgG2a (Becton Dickinson). For HLA-DO and HLA-DM, the following mouse mAb were used: HLA-DM (Becton Dickinson) and IgG1 isotype control (Becton Dickinson); FITC-labeled HLA-DO (Becton Dickinson) and IgG2b (Becton Dickinson).

Of note, IL-12p70 release was almost completely abolished by the combined sequential use of R848 and CC [mean relative decrease 0.97 (&#x000b1;0.06)]. However, incubation with R848 and CC increased the ability of MoDC to prime na&#x000ef;ve T cells in an allogeneic MLR in accordance with the observations for phenotypic maturation: addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h pre-incubation with R848 enhanced T cell stimulating capacity, but not to the same level as seen for CC alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was undertaken to investigate the various MoDC vaccine preparation strategies in order to create an optimized MoDC vaccine for the treatment of MRD in AML. The ability of HD-derived MoDC to take up whole cell-derived material in combination with TLR-L was investigated in order to enhance the uptake of LAA. Furthermore, we explored the capability of MoDC to mature under the influence of various TLR-L and a standard CC as positive control.</p><p>Immature DC are capable of taking up Ag, e.g., from infected cells or tumor cells, in the form of apoptotic bodies or necrotic cell particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Next to the Ag source, agents such as TLR-L or cytokines can affect the outcome of this uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Upon encounter with for instance microbial agents or other inflammatory stimuli, DC mature from cells specialized in Ag uptake into cells specialized in T cell stimulation. Inflammatory cytokines are considered as strong maturation inducers but, as we demonstrated, CC inhibits further Ag uptake by DC. In contrast, TLR-L are known to enhance the uptake of antigenic material and subsequently induce maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In accordance with this, we found the enhanced uptake after co-incubation with TLR- L R848, whereas addition of CC after 24&#x000a0;h of co-incubation with R848 halted further uptake.</p><p>The method by which leukemic cell death was induced influenced the amount of cellular material taken up by MoDC: less uptake was achieved in DC after co-incubation with lysate as compared to apoptotic cells. In the process of dying, apoptotic cells are known to shed immunogenic particles, i.e., so-called blebs. Murine studies have demonstrated that these blebs are taken up more efficiently by DC than the remaining, larger, apoptotic bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This may offer an explanation for our observation that the apoptotic AML cells are more efficiently taken up by MoDC than AML lysates. Additional knowledge about the ability of DC to prime LAA-specific T cells is clearly warranted to further differentiate between both whole leukemic cell-derived antigen sources.</p><p>One of the key players in the MHC class II presentation pathway is CLIP and its regulators HLA-DM and HLA-DO. TLR-L regulate processing of the invariant chain (Ii) and influence the exchange of CLIP with antigenic peptides. TLR signaling is necessary to direct the internalized antigens via the classical pathway for presentation by MHC II, whereas tolerogenic DC can upregulate CLIP expression and hamper T cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consistent with this, CLIP expression was decreased when DC and apoptotic AML cells were co-incubated in the presence of R848 and/or CC, indicative of a putative increase in LAA presentation by the loaded MoDC.</p><p>Maturation of DC is necessary to enable migration to lymph nodes and activation of T cells. Consistent with literature, CC induced upregulation of CD86, expression of CD83, CCR7, and hence enhanced migratory capacity, the latter most likely due to the presence of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the cocktail. R848 is able to induce phenotypic maturation, but far less prominently than CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this setting, our results indicate that R848 is rather an enhancer of antigen uptake than a straightforward maturation inducer, whereas CC only promotes maturation. We hypothesized that both high uptake and maturation might be achieved by combining prolonged R848 incubation (24&#x000a0;h) followed by the addition of CC. However, maturation was only slightly increased compared to R848 alone. These data indicate that TLR-L antagonize the maturation efficacy of CC. Recent studies showed the inhibitory effects of TLR-L LPS and Poly(I:C) on DC by the activation of so-called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). It has been described that SOCS1, 2, and 3 are required for appropriate TLR signaling in maturing human DC via both the MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. By first enhancing uptake with TLR-L, the DC might become resistant to cytokines due to the activation of SOCS1/2, resulting in disturbed maturation. Moreover, TLR-mediated induction of maturation-inhibitory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) might be responsible for this maturation inhibitory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We did the attempt inhibition of putatively involved down-stream signaling elements (a.o. p38 MAPK, PI3&#x000a0;K, STAT3) to abolish this R848-mediated block in CC-induced DC maturation, but to no avail.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub>, part of the cytokine cocktail, is known to impair production of IL-12p70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As a consequence of reduced IL-12p70 levels, immunosuppressive cells, such as T regulatory cells might be recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Various combinations of cytokines and other DC-maturing factors, such as TLR-L, direct MoDC maturation towards a migratory and/or Th1-activating cytokine release profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Recently, it was shown that the simultaneous addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TLR 3/7/8 ligands resulted in higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules on DC as well as IL-12p70 production and migration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We hypothesized that by pre-incubating MoDC with R848, followed by maturation with CC (containing PGE<sub>2</sub>), both effective IL-12p70 production, migratory capacity as well as improved AML cell uptake might be established. Addition of CC after prolonged incubation with R848 enhanced the migratory capacity, but not to the same levels as CC alone. Furthermore, IL-12p70 production was abolished as compared to CC stimulation alone. This might be explained by the longer incubation time and, thereby exhaustion of MoDC before measuring the overnight IL-12p70 production. However, in a mixed leukocyte reaction, we demonstrated that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell stimulatory capacity of R848 and/or CC matured MoDC was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that irrespective of IL-12p70 production, R848 and/or CC matured DC is able to stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since IL-12p70 is an important cytokine in Th1 and CTL activation, careful analysis of the ability to prime functional leukemia-specific T cells is needed to design optimal MoDC vaccine preparation strategies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the uptake of leukemic cells by MoDC and their maturation state is differentially affected by TLR-L R848 and CC. As compared to CC alone, the sequential use of R848 and CC interfered with the effective MoDC maturation as indicated by diminished migration and T cell stimulatory capacity, and abolished IL-12p70 production. These findings do not justify incorporation of TLR7/8-L in DC-maturing cocktails for clinical development of whole-cell AML-loaded MoDC vaccines.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dinja Oosterhoff for technical advice and assistance.
