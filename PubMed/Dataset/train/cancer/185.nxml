FUO is defined as &#x0201c;body core temperature &#x0003c;38.3&#x000b0;C on several occasions lasting for &#x0003c;3 weeks but no cause found despite routine clinical investigations for &#x0003c;1 week in hospital&#x0201d;. Malignancy is an important cause of FUO, and the aim of this study is to demonstrate prevalence of malignancy as a cause of FUO demonstrated in PET-CT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 231 patients with FUO were prospectively studied using PET-CT after negative conventional investigations. Final diagnosis was based on biopsy, microbiological tests and imaging follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The cause of FUO was identified only in 129/231 (56%) patients, of which 27 (12%) were due to malignancy and 102 were due to benign causes.</p><p>PET-CT was true positive in 98/231 patients, of which 22 were malignant (pancreas, colon, oesophagus, head and neck, lymphoma) and 76 were benign.</p><p>False positive in 18/231 patients, due to increased FDG-uptake in reactive nodes.</p><p>True negative in 84/231 patients, clinically self-limiting conditions with full spontaneous recovery.</p><p>False negative in 31/231 patients, of which 5 were malignant (myeloma, pancreas, renal, colon, liver) and 26 were benign.</p><p>PET-CT identified malignancy in 22/27 (81%). PET-CT misses poorly-FDG-avid malignancy or lesions embedded within normal physiological uptake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study 12% (27/231) of FUO are caused by malignancy. PET-CT demonstrated the site of malignancy in 81% (22/27). Although PET-CT plays an important role in the management of FUO, some malignancy may be missed (19%) so further investigations are still required if spontaneous recovery is not achieved.</p></sec></body></article>
