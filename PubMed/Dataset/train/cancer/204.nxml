Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is reported the most common subtype of lung cancer. Initial staging of NSCLC is highly associated with the choice of treatment and prognosis of the patients.

In 2008, lung cancer accounted for 14.5&#x000a0;% of all newly diagnosed malignancies in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], 85% of diagnosed lung cancers were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Surgical resection remains the curable approach among the treatments of choice in the management of NSCLC, despite the continuous improvement and development in the theraputic treatments so far. Initial TNM staging is important in the decision-making process of management as well as in predicting prognosis of the patients with NSCLC. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Various imaging modalities have been used for preoperative T staging of NSCLC. Computed tomography (CT) has been considered as standard of reference for preoperative evaluation of intrathoracic spread of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the assessment of preoperative T staging in lung cancer on CT is still not totally satisfying, owing to its limitations in evaluation of tumor invasion into adjacent structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly utilized in preoperative staging of lung cancerdue to its strength in excellent soft tissue contrast and high spatial resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacies of 3.0-T MRI and 64-MDCT for determining T staging of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and written informed consent were obtained from all patients. From July 2011 to February 2013, a total of 51 consecutive patients pathologically diagnosed with NSCLC who underwent MRI and MDCT examinations were enrolled in this study. Of these 51 patients, 6 were excluded owing to the history of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 4) and intolerable claustrophobia occurred during the scanning (n = 2). The remaining 45 patients (30 men and 15 women; age range, 32-70 years; mean age, 56&#x000a0;years) were included in this study. MDCT and MRI scans were performed within a 7-day interval for each patient.

A bolus of 20 ml gadolinium diethylene triaminepenta acetate (Gd-DTPA) as the intravenous contrast agent was administered for all patients at a rate of 3&#x000a0;ml/sec. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR scan was started 5 s after the completion of the administration. Each scanning of three continuous phases was obtained with breath-hold in 15 s, and in between there was a 15 s internal. Totally 24 continuous phases of images were achieved in 4 min.</p><p>A64-MDCT scanner (GE LightSpeed VCT, GE Medical System) was used in this study.

Two groups of 3 experienced radiologists (N.W., Y.H. and W.T., with 8-30 years of experience in thoracic CT imaging; H.OY., L.L. and M.L., with 5-20 years of experience in thoracic MRI) interpreted the MDCT manifestations and MR findings, respectively. Consensus was achieved to make a final decision when disagreement occurred between readers inside the group. Readers in each group were aware the patients were diagnosed with NSCLC, whereas blinded to the manifestations of the opposite modality and pathological findings. Intra- and extra-pulamonary anatomic structures studied including the size of tumor, involvement of adjacent organs or chest wall, and lung metastases were evaluated according to the 7<sup>th</sup> Edition of the TMN Classification for Lung and Pleural Tumors. Visceral pleural invasion were identified as any contact between the tumor and pleura with associated pleural thickening or retraction, whereas the visualized extra-pleural fat plane was present. The contact between the mass and chest wall exceeding 3 cm or more, presence of obtuse angle between the mass and the chest wall, mass extending into the chest wall, loss of the extra-pleural fat plane, and rib destruction were the criteria in the assessment on chest wall invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The following criteria was used in the identification of mediastinal invasion: extensive contact between the tumor and mediastinum, pleural and pericardial thickening, contact of 180&#x000b0; or greater between the tumor and mediastinal central vessels, and loss of the fat plane between the tumor and the mediastinal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

In our study, the overall accuracy for assessment of T staging in NSCLC on CT and MRI was 84.4&#x000a0;% (38/45) and 82.2&#x000a0;% (37/45), respectively, the difference between both modalities was not statistically significant, and was similar to the study reported by Yi et al, in which the primary tumors were correctly staged in 101 (82&#x000a0;%) patients on integrated PET/CT and in 106 (86&#x000a0;%) patients on whole body 3.0&#x000a0;T MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In our study, involvement of mediastinal pleura (in that case tumor was staged with T3) of 2 cases were misrepresented on MDCT, which caused the underestimation of T staging in advanced tumor on MDCT, probably related to its relatively lower soft tissues contrast. Study has proved that MRI was more useful for distinguishing T3 and T4 tumors from early staged diseases owing to the superior contrast resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One case of mediastinal pleura invasion proven by pathology was missed on MRI. It might be associated with the absence of cardiac-gated T1-weighted sequence applied in our study, as with this technique, MRI was considered being helpful in reducing the cardiac motion artifact that significantly influenced the evaluation of tumor involvement of areas of mediastinum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, 1 case with false positive of invasion of mediastinal pleura was occured on MRI, which might be due to the challenge to distinguish tumor invasion from benign inflammatory pleural adhesion on imaging modalities.</p><p>Contrast agents utilized in the developed MRI systems have shown some advantage on the staging of NSCLC. Previous research indicated that contrast-enhanced MRI was more useful in assessment of cardiovascular and mediastinal invasion than that on MDCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the comparable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy on MRI were reported up to 90&#x000a0;%, 87&#x000a0;%, and 88&#x000a0;%, respectively. Even though the advanced-stage cases included were limited, the advantages of enhanced MRI were also noted in our study: 3 cases associated with mediastinum invasion (presented as pulmonary artery involvement in this study) were accurately interpreted on MRI whereas only 1 of these cases was identified on MDCT. On the other hand, MRI was widely recognized to be more helpful in depicting tumor extent of the lung cancer arising from the central areas owing to the capability of MRI in distinguishing the tissues between the tumor and the associated atelectasis or pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as shown in the present study (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014). The signal representing primary tumor was noted significantly differed from that of secondary atelectasis and pneumonia (i.e., tumor manifested as hypointensity, whereas secondary changes presented as hyperintensity) on early phase of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Four cases of central NSCLC with secondary changes confirmed by pathology were not revealed even on enhanced MRI, which might be related to the obstructive changes in the affected bronchus caused by limited-stage tumors were not sufficient to produce significant reduction of the air flow in the corresponding airways and lung tissues, thus were not visible on both modalities.</p><p>In this study, accuracy of diagnosis on determination of visceral pleural invasion (in that case tumor was staged with T2) assessed on MRI was statistically higher than that achieved on MDCT (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003). Although patient with chest wall invasion (in that case tumor was staged with T3) were used to the contraindication of surgical excision for lung cancer, studies have suggested that selected patients with chest wall infiltration who underwent surgical excision might be benefited with a better chance of survival by developed surgical technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Infiltration into the extra pleural fat, an associated pleural thickening, an obtuse angle, or more than 3&#x000a0;cm contact with the pleura are thought to be the sensitive but nonspecific findings in the diagnosis of chest wall invasion, the reliable manifestation suggestive of chest wall invasion is rib bone destruction. Previous studies have shown that sagittal and coronal MRI images with better tissue contrast resolution compared to that of CT were more effective in evaluating chest wall invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this study, 4 cases of NSCLC presenting chest wall invasion were accurately diagnosed on either MRI or MDCT, for the latter, which might be contributed by the improved diagnostic capability of MDCT with multiplanar reconstruction capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For the case of superior sulcus tumor with involvement of surrounding structures (e.g., vessels), MRI has shown superiority of assessment of automatic relationship between the tumor and surrounding structure.</p><p>The distinction between tumors staged T3 and T4 on imaging has considered being clinically significant as the T3 lesions are potentially resectable while T4 lesions are not. In the present study, one tumor initially staged T4 on CT was diagnosed as T3 on MRI which proven by pathology. Furthermore, none of lesions staged T3 by pathology misdiagnosed as T4 on MRI. However, two of 3 cases staged T4 on MRI then proven by pathology were misdiagnosed on CT. For the patients with advanced-stage diseases, accurate interpretation on imaging features might improve the outcomes in the patients who were classified as the candidates of surgery, and reduce the morbidity and mortality rates in the ones who were treated with conservative approaches other than aggressive resection.</p><p>Selection bias is one of the major and common limitations in the researches applied the study design similar to that utilized in our study. Only three patients with primary tumor staged T4 were enrolled, as pathological evidence are only available for the patients who underwent operation on a potentially resectable stage of diseases. Only eight tumors with a measurement less than 3&#x000a0;cm in size were included in our study, as fewer patients referred to our institution that a national cancer center in our country presented early stage disease. Patients with certain positive indicators which should be concerned in the staging of lung cancer such as metastatic nodule were not included in the study. Such selection bias had certain impact on the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy in the present study; further study characterized by an enlarged sample size should be performed to confirm the validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, both MDCT and MRI provided acceptable accuracies in preoperative T staging of NSCLC.
