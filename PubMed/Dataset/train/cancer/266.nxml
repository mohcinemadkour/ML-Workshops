Like other TNF family members, in vivo and in vitro activity of CD40L requires a homotrimeric configuration, and growing evidence suggests that bioactivity depends on higher-order clustering of CD40. We generated a novel formulation of human recombinant CD40L (CD40L-Tri) in which the CD40L extracellular domain and a trimerization motif are connected by a long flexible peptide linker. We demonstrate that CD40L-Tri significantly expands normal CD19+ B cells by over 20- to 30-fold over 14&#x000a0;days and induces B cells to become highly immunostimulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Consistent with these results, CD40L-Tri-activated B cells could effectively stimulate antigen-specific T responses (against the influenza M1 peptide) from normal volunteers. In addition, CD40L-Tri could induce malignant B cells to become effective APCs, such that tumor-directed immune responses could be probed. Together, our studies demonstrate the potent immune-stimulatory effects of CD40L-Tri on B cells that enable their expansion of antigen-specific human T cells. The potent bioactivity of CD40L-Tri is related to its ability to self-multimerize, which may be facilitated by its long peptide linker.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00262-012-1331-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CD40</kwd><kwd>CD40L</kwd><kwd>B lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Antigen-presenting cell</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CD40:CD40Ligand (CD40L) pathway provides essential signals for T cell help for B cell antibody production and dendritic cell priming of CD8+ T cell responses. CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily and is a type I transmembrane protein that is highly expressed on diverse cell types including many antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The physiological ligand of CD40 is CD40L (CD154). Expressed on activated T cells, this type II transmembrane protein is a member of the TNF family of ligands and naturally forms a trimer on the cell surface. The interaction of CD40L with CD40 effectively increases function of APCs, through the induction of costimulatory molecules as well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Numerous reports have demonstrated that APCs that are activated as a result of the CD40L-CD40 interaction induce T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Together, these studies have supported the promise of CD40L-activated B cells for immunotherapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A widely available murine fibroblast cell line, engineered to stably express human CD40L (NIH3T3/tCD40L), has been shown to induce rapid expansion of normal human CD19+ B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These studies have provided proof-of-concept that CD40L-mediated stimulation can feasibly generate a large source of autologous APCs from relatively small amounts of peripheral blood. However, the presence of and response to mouse xenoantigens within the 3T3 cell system precludes its further clinical development. At the same time, despite the highly attractive immunostimulatory profile of CD40L, a purified soluble recombinant human formulation has not been readily available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>We sought to construct a soluble recombinant CD40L molecule that was sufficiently active to expand human B cells in vitro for use as APCs. A number of soluble recombinant forms of CD40L have been described with varying levels of bioactivity. These include formulations comprised of solely the TNF homology domain, of the TNF homology domain with the 75 amino acid stalk that joins the TNF domain to the membrane, and of each of the above joined to an isoleucine zipper trimerization motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, multimeric formulations of CD40L trimers have been made by linking CD40L to Acrp30 to produce a 2-trimer, or with the body of surfactant protein D to produce a 4-trimer protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some of these forms have short peptide linkers of 2&#x02013;5 amino acids between the multimerizing motif and the CD40L. Studies have shown that the isoleucine zipper or the natural stalk domain do not increase CD40L bioactivity through trimerization, which is an intrinsic property of the TNF homology domain, but by stabilizing the structure by reducing unfolding of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In general, studies have shown that the greatest bioactivity is seen with stabilized trimers and multimerized trimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Since flexible peptide linkers of approximately 17 amino acids have been shown to optimally support folding of independent protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we reasoned that inclusion of a long linker between the trimerization motif and the CD40L extracellular domain would best support CD40L bioactivity. We consequently used this approach to design a novel formulation of CD40L designated as CD40L-Tri. We demonstrate that CD40L-Tri readily self-multimerizes in solution and has potent immunostimulatory activity. These results lead us to speculate that the freedom of movement provided by the long peptide linker facilitates this process of self-multimerization and thereby enables effective cross-linking of CD40 on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from normal adult volunteers and patients enrolled on clinical research protocols at the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC) approved by the DFHCC Human Subjects Protection Committee.

The coding sequence was codon-optimized for CHO cell expression and synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ). The calculated molecular weight after signal cleavage is 30,093 daltons with a pI of 7.63.

The pEFGF vector is composed of 4.1&#x000a0;Kb 5&#x02032; of the hamster EF-1 gene including the EF-1 promoter, ending in a Kozak consensus start site that includes Nco I, EcoRV, and Sal I sites, followed by 0.5&#x000a0;Kb encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA, the 4.3&#x000a0;kb hamster EF-1 polyadenylation and 3&#x02032; flanking sequence, ampicillin resistance, and origin of replication. This vector was based on the finding that non-promoter genomic elements in the hamster EF-1 locus support high-level protein expression independent of where the vector is integrated into the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These non-promoter elements might include insulator elements, scaffold/matrix attachment regions, transcriptional enhancers, or terminators. The elements of the vector were generated by high-fidelity PCR with a unique restriction site and 15-bp overlap at the junction of each element, joined by In-Fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and confirmed by sequencing. The pEFGF vector was digested with Nco I and Sal I, and the CD40L-Tri coding sequence was amplified from the synthetic template with primers including 15-bp overlaps to the Nco I and Sal I sites of the vector and joined by In-Fusion. DHFR-deficient CHO cells (DG44) were electroporated with Mlu-linearized CD40L-Tri vector. After 2&#x000a0;days in non-selective media, cells were cultured in MEM&#x003b1; media without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, 10&#x000a0;% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1&#x000a0;% glutamax, penicillin/streptomycin, and 15&#x000a0;mg/ml gentamicin. After 5&#x000a0;days, methotrexate was added to 25&#x000a0;nM and culture was continued until colonies grew out. Colonies were pooled and the concentration of methotrexate was increased in twofold steps to 1,000&#x000a0;nM, waiting for robust growth at each stage. Cells were subcloned at the 50 and 1,000&#x000a0;nM stages and selected for highest production level by ELISA. Cells were adapted to low-serum media, and culture supernatant was concentrated 12-fold by 50 kDa cut-off hollow fiber ultrafiltration (Spectrum Labs). Concentrated supernatant was passed through a column of His-Select HF Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma), and the column was washed with 10 and 50&#x000a0;mM imidazole in 50&#x000a0;mM phosphate, 300&#x000a0;mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with 150&#x000a0;mM imidazole in the same buffer. The eluate was dialyzed twice against PBS, pH 7.0, and sterile filtered through 0.22 micron filter with a yield of 2.5&#x000a0;mg per liter. Of note, the 50&#x000a0;mM imidazole wash was necessary to remove a 55 kDa CHO cell protein, legumain. Endotoxin was determined by LAL gel assay to be less than 2 EU/mg protein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Other CD40L formulations</title><p>We tested 3 other formulations of human CD40L. Culture supernatants containing multimeric CD40L (&#x02018;Ultra-CD40L&#x02019;, kindly provided by Richard Kornbluth, Multimeric, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA) were produced by fusing the extracellular domain of CD40L with the body of surfactant protein D (a spontaneously multimerizing molecule) resulting in a 4-trimer soluble protein. We also tested a homotrimeric form of soluble human recombinant CD40L with a short linker, which we designated as &#x02018;shrtCD40L&#x02019; (#2706-CL; R&#x00026;D, Minneapolis, MN, USA). This form is only robustly active when cross-linked by monoclonal antibodies against the amino-terminal epitope tags (HexaHis or HA). As a positive control, we tested the natural membrane-bound form of human CD40L made by stable transfection of NIH3T3 cells, termed &#x02018;NIH3T3/tCD40L&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Expansion of human B cells with CD40L</title><p>CD19+ B cells were isolated from normal PBMC by immunomagnetic selection (CD19+ microbeads, Miltenyi, Auburn, CA, USA), and seeded at 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 24-well plate.

To exclude the possibility that positive CD19+ B cell selection could by itself activate B cells, we performed CD40L-Tri expansion and immunophenotyping on negatively selected CD19+ B cells (B isolation Kit II, Miltenyi, Auburn, CA, USA). No discernable differences in results of CD40L activation were observed between positively and negatively selected B cells (Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;1).

The development of methods to stimulate and monitor immunity against these leukemia cells, however, has been impaired by the poor antigen-presenting ability of CLL cells due to their low expression of costimulatory molecules. These defects can be reversed through stimulation with CD40L, for example, through use of the widely used NIH3T3/tCD40L system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Growing evidence, however, suggests that homotrimerization alone is necessary but not sufficient for maximal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Rather, higher-order clustering of CD40 appears to be required for optimal CD40 signaling. These concepts have been supported by studies demonstrating that multimeric forms of CD40L homotrimers were more active than homotrimers alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In the current manuscript, we describe a novel formulation of a highly active single trimer recombinant formulation, CD40L-Tri, that is constructed using a long flexible linker.

Generally, TNFR family members are monomers that interact with a TNF family member by a single TNFR binding in each of the 3 interfacial grooves formed by trimerization of TNF, thus generating a 3:3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, crystallography studies have demonstrated that the co-crystal structure of CD40:CD40L unexpectedly showed a 2:3 stoichiometry with a CD40 occupying only 2 of the 3 available CD40L grooves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We therefore speculate that the addition of the long 17 aa linker in the CD40L-Tri molecule provides an extra degree of freedom that enables effective CD40 signaling on cell surfaces.</p><p>CD40L-Tri is straightforward to manufacture, and could be readily applied for investigative studies in immunotherapy and B cell biology. We demonstrate that CD40L-Tri-activated B cells can generate autologous APCs with equivalent potency as dendritic cells, but have the advantage that little starting material is needed. Compared with the conventionally available NIH3T3/tCD40L cells, using recombinant CD40L-Tri is far less labor intensive, easier to control, and eliminates the xenoantigen exposure that can confound studies of T cell reactivity. We also show that CD40L-Tri-activated B cells function well as targets of T cell responses. On the other hand, there is a risk of expanding Tregs using CD40L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; however, we did not see evidence of this in our M1-peptide experiments that started with PBMC.</p><p>A high priority for the field of cancer immunotherapy is the increased availability of potent immunostimulatory agents for enabling the clinical development of immune treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].
