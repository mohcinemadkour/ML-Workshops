TNBC is a term derived from tumors that are characterized by the absence of ER, PgR, and HER2. So patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based therapies. TNBCs are biologically aggressive, although some reports suggest that they respond to chemotherapy better than other types of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. This is due to: shortened disease-free interval in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting and a more aggressive course in the metastatic setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS </title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>triple-negative</kwd><kwd>HER2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in women after lung cancer and it is the most common cancer among women worldwide (23% of all new cancer cases)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to the breast cancer phenotype where the estrogen and progesterone receptor are negative, as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and there is a lack of overexpression of HER2 as assessed by IHC or the absence of its gene amplification as assessed by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization technique<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>.</p><p>An estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide.

Of these TNBC cases, about 75% are &#x0201c;basal-like&#x0201d;<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. As regard the molecular complexity of TNBC, six subtypes of TNBC have been identified, basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. TNBC is an important area of research for both researchers and clinicians because (I) TNBC is a poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS); (II) no effective specific targeted therapy is readily available for TNBC; (III) there is a clustering of TNBC cases in premenopausal women and in women of African descent; and (IV) the overlap of BRCA1-associated breast cancers with the TNBC phenotype is significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment modalities of TNBC</title><p>Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based therapy because of the loss of target receptors such as ER, PGR, and HER-2. Hence, surgery and chemotherapy, individually or in combination, appear to be the only available modalities. However, some studies have identified certain receptors as targets for new therapeutic drugs.</p><sec><title>Surgery in TNBC</title><sec><title>Effect of TN status on surgical decision making</title><p>Many studies are done to determine whether patients with TN disease were more likely to choose mastectomy over lumpectomy.

Also several neoadjuvant studies have sought to determine the additive benefit of incorporating novel chemotherapeutics with standard chemotherapy like anthracycline, taxanes, antimetabolites, platinum agents and novel microtubule stabilizing agents<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>. Although the specific adjuvant regimens that may be most effective for TNBC remains incompletely defined for both early stage and advanced disease, third-generation chemotherapy regimens using dose dense or metronomic polychemotherapy like those offered to other high-risk patients are among the most effective tools presently available<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>. Platinum agents have seen renewed interest in TNBC since the association of BRCA1 mutations and dysfunctional DNA repair with TN may indicate an increased sensitivity toward DNA-damaging agents like platinum agents based on preclinical and clinical data.

The PARP1 gene encodes a chromatin-associated enzyme that modifies various nuclear proteins. This gene is involved in the molecular events leading to cell recovery from DNA damage.

Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are required for the homologous recombination pathway to function properly.

As regard surgery in TNBC and despite being more aggressive disease, surgical decision making likely rests on more traditional clinicopathological variables (like patient age, tumor size, and tumor grade) and patient preference.</p><p>As regard radiotherapy in TNBC, it is given traditionally as indicated in other breast cancer subtypes following mastectomy or CBS, but there is still some controversy on this issue. The controversy arises from the fact that TNBCs are rapidly growing and locally aggressive cancers that may represent a limit to the general principle saying that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy in early stage (T<sub>1-2</sub>N<sub>0</sub>) is equivalent to mastectomy. Also the general consensus that postmastectomy radiation therapy is not indicated for patients with node-negative tumors less than 5 cm in diameter should not oversimplified in TN tumors.</p><p>The therapeutic strategies for the management of TNBC are targeting DNA repair complex like (platinum compounds and taxanes), p53 like (taxanes), cell proliferation like (anthracycline containing regimen) and targeted therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies have consistently reported higher RRs in TNBC than non-TNBC and pCR has been shown to predict improved long-term outcomes for TNBC.</p><p>The specific adjuvant regimens that may be most effective for TNBC are still being to be determined. Numerous large randomized trials have established the benefit of adjuvant anthracyclines and taxanes in breast cancer.</p><p>All options are proposed in first-line treatment but the majority of recommendation indicated taxanes for first-line therapy while recommendations for second-line therapy were more commonly single agent capecitabine or combination of capecitabine and vinorelbine, or gemcitabine and vinorelbine or a platinum-based regimen.</p><p>The most frequently recommended platinum-based regimens for first-line therapy and second-line is cisplatin plus gemcitabine, carboplatin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin plus gemcitabine.</p><p>Several targeted therapies are being successfully developed like Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is a nuclear DNA-binding enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks and has a key role in the signaling of DNA single-strand breaks as part of the repair process. Initial exciting data suggesting that iniparib improved outcome in patients with TNBC in combination with chemotherapy have not been confirmed in phase III studies, although there are clearly patients who benefit from this agent.</p><p>Several other targeted agents are being developed in the setting of managing TNBC including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FGFR2, VEGF, and mTOR.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflicts of interest are disclosed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">American Cancer Society.
