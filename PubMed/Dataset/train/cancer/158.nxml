One of the current unmet needs in oncology is the assessment of metastatic bone disease and diffuse bone marrow involvement, for which WB-DWI appears highly promising. For WB-DWI to be deployed successfully, meticulous data acquisition is necessary to obtain the highest quality images possible. Image post-processing is required to display images in a manner that is easy for referring clinicians to understand, especially on serial follow-up studies. Image interpretation requires knowledge on what is being displayed on WB-DWI. Key to the establishment of WB-DWI in clinical practice is the recognition of interpretative pitfalls, which will be discussed in detail including false-positive and false-negative cases. The potential clinical applications for WB-DWI are illustrated with case examples.</p></sec></body></article>
