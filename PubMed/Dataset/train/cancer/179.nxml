Suspicious lesions were defined by the imaging gold-standard of non- enhanced T1-w/T2-w- MRI and low-dose CT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sensitivities were 77% for DWI and 47% for PET in a per-lesion analysis of 128 lesions shown on MRI/CT. In untreated patients however, sensitivity was 90% for both functional modalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Discrepancy of DWI and references resulted mainly from limitations due to under diagnosing smaller lesions and missing lesions near the edge of the field of view in this whole- body protocol setting. Mismatches of PET and references were retrospectively predominantly seen in 5 previously treated patients, who had responded to therapy. Since glucose metabolism is a sensitive parameter that responds prior to size regression in the course of chemotherapy, our reference may have revealed false positive findings, i.e., responding but morphologically persistent lesions. Since PET also has limitations in spatial resolution and detection of diffuse infiltration, PET/MRI might combine excellent soft-tissue contrast (T1/T2fatsat) with a sensitive response assessment without missing focal infiltration of prognostic significance.</p></sec></body></article>
