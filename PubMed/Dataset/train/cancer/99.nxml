They were classified into two groups: group 1 &#x02018;Diagnostic mammograms&#x02019; of symptomatic women and group 2 &#x02018;Screening mammograms&#x02019;. Dense breasts assigned as ACR3 and ACR4 presented 69% (<italic>n</italic> = 114/166) of the studied cases. FFDM and 3D tomosynthesis examination was done and imaging findings were evaluated before and after the use of 3D tomosynthesis images.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Both modalities were compared regarding detection and diagnosis, each individually assessed, using the Pearson Chi Square tests. Detection (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.006) and diagnosis (<italic>P</italic> value: 0.048) of breast lesions dramatically improved when 3D tomosynthesis images were considered in the evaluation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of digital mammography was 60%, 20.7% and 48% have significantly enhanced on applying tomosynthesis to be 94.5%, 74% and 89.7%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Three-dimensional tomosynthesis significantly enhanced the detection and characterization of breast lesions on digital mammography especially in the context of dense breast parenchyma (ACR 3&#x00026;4).</p></sec></body></article>
