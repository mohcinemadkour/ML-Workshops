Adequate staging and therapeutic evaluation is necessary for therapy planning. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be useful for staging and therapy response evaluation. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria In Solid Tumors (PERCIST) criteria were compared in the evaluation of response assessment and prognostic factors were defined in a cohort of SCLC patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-nine consecutive patients with SCLC were included in this study. Sixteen patients had extensive disease and 13 had limited disease. All patients had chemotherapy, 21 had thoracic radiotherapy. FDG-PET/CT scans were performed before and after therapy to evaluate treatment response. Metabolic responses were assessed using the EORTC criteria and PERCIST criteria. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using a Cox model to investigate the association between progression-free and overall survival time with a number of covariates. <bold>Results:</bold> There was perfect concordance between the EORTC and PERCIST criteria. Eight patients had a complete metabolic response (CMR), 9 had a partial metabolic response (PMR), 5 had stable metabolic disease (SMD) and 7 had progressive metabolic disease (PMD). Overall survival time in patients with CMR was significantly longer compared with patients who did not have CMR. The initial or delayed CMR and post-therapeutic standardized uptake value corrected for lean body mass were significantly associated with overall survival. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> CMR on post-therapeutic FDG-PET/CT in patients with SCLC is an important prognostic factor and may help decision making for therapeutic management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>FDG-PET/CT</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd><kwd>EORTC</kwd><kwd>PERCIST</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States for men and women. The estimated number of new cases in 2010 was 222,520<sup>[1]</sup>. Ten to 15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancers (SCLC). SCLC is more aggressive than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and requires a dedicated therapeutic approach. Initial staging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is sensitive and specific for SCLC except for the assessment of brain metastases. It also leads to improve patient management compared with conventional imaging<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. SCLC is classified as limited disease (LD) or extensive disease (ED). Therapy consists of combined chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for patients with LD and systemic chemotherapy for patients with ED. SCLC is chemosensitive and most patients show clear response to therapy. Unfortunately, most patients relapse soon after the end of therapy. The accurate assessment of response to therapy is essential for identifying non-responders and avoiding inefficient therapy and its potential side effects. Identification of patients who are more likely to relapse can lead to further treatment such as consolidation therapy or closer follow-up.</p><p>The 2 most widely used sets of criteria to evaluate response to therapy with FDG-PET in solid tumours are the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria, based on the standardized uptake value (SUV), which has become the standard for assessment of metabolic tumour response and follow-up in solid tumours since 1999<sup>[3]</sup>, and the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria In Solid Tumors (PERCIST) criteria, described by Wahl et&#x000a0;al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> in 2009. PERCIST criteria are based on a combination of the radiologic Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>, and the EORTC criteria with the difference that SUV should be corrected for lean body mass (SUL or SUV lean body mass). Both of these criteria allow the measurement of tumoural response in the absence of anatomic change through assessment of metabolic activity.</p><p>We have compared the EORTC and PERCIST criteria in a population of SCLC patients and assessed how metabolic response was associated with progression-free survival and overall survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Twenty-nine consecutive patients with SCLC referred to the lung cancer multidisciplinary meeting of the Limoges University Hospital were included retrospectively.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the EORTC and PERCIST criteria for the assessment of therapy response. In the era of personalized medicine and targeted therapy, there is a need to find the most robust, accurate and reproducible tools to evaluate therapeutic response. This study is a first step in this direction because it shows that the use of the EORTC and PERCIST criteria leads to identical assessment of therapeutic response in a population of 29 patients with SCLC. The EORTC criteria were first described in 1999, and have been used and studied since then and are recognized criteria. The PERCIST criteria are more recent and have not been validated by large prospective studies. The perfect agreement we have shown in this study is a first step towards validating the PERCIST criteria. However, is there a need for multiple criteria, especially if they yield the same results. The nuclear medicine community might benefit more from one widely accepted set of criteria to assess metabolic response to therapy, especially given its growing importance.</p><p>The major finding in our study is that the overall survival was longer in patients with CMR compared with patients with non-CMR. Survival time was nearly 3 times as long in patients showing CMR on PET/CT as in patients showing any other response. Progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the CMR group. What is particularly interesting is that our population was very heterogeneous in terms of therapy conditions. Some patients started chemotherapy before PET 1, some patients had chemotherapy and TRT between PET 1 and PET 2 and other patients had chemotherapy alone between PET 1 and PET 2. Furthermore different chemotherapy regimens were used. Despite this marked therapeutic heterogeneity, patients with CMR lived significantly longer than patients who were not in CMR after treatment. Patients who achieved CMR after failing or relapsing after first-line chemotherapy had prolonged survival times.</p><p>To our knowledge, 4 previous reports have assessed metabolic therapeutic responses with FDG-PET in SCLC. Azad et&#x000a0;al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated the response to therapy in 46 patients with SCLC on the basis of the extent of the disease (LD and ED) before and after therapy. Patients who remained in the LD stage after therapy had longer survival rates than patients who went from LD to ED. Patients who went from ED to LD during therapy had longer survival times than patients who remained in ED. Yamamoto et&#x000a0;al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> studied 12 patients with SCLC with early and late FDG-PET to evaluate therapeutic responses. Change in SUV<sub>max</sub> was used to define responders and non-responders. Eleven of the 12 patients were responders. The number of patients included in the study was too small to associate metabolic responses with survival rates. Onitilo et&#x000a0;al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated the prognostic value of post-treatment FDG-PET in 22 patients with LD SCLC. Within 4 months of the end of chemotherapy, the patients had a post-treatment PET scan. The interpretation consisted of visual analysis or SUV-based analysis with SUV<sub>max</sub> &#x0003e;2.5 considered positive. Progression-free survival was significantly longer for PET-negative patients than for PET-positive patients. Although not statistically significant, the estimated average survival time for the PET-negative patients (29.2 months) was longer than for the PET-positive patients (10.3 months). Fischer et&#x000a0;al<italic>.</italic><sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> prospectively investigated 20 patients using PET/CT; the CT was diagnostic and contrast-enhanced. Therapeutic response was evaluated on CT according to the RECIST criteria and on PET/CT, according to the criteria described by MacManus et&#x000a0;al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. Metabolic changes on PET were significantly correlated with changes in size on CT. No difference was found between a visual and a semi-quantitative analysis on the PET data.</p><p>Our study is the first to use standardized criteria to assess therapy response in patients with SCLC. Although the 4 reports mentioned earlier found better survival in patients who had a metabolic response on FDG-PET, the criteria used were different in each study, thus limiting the power of potential comparisons and future meta-analyses.</p><p>We found that CMR (whether initial or delayed) was an independent prognostic factor, significantly associated with overall survival. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate metabolic responses as a prognostic factor in patients with SCLC. A high post-therapeutic SUL<sub>total</sub> value also identified patients with a worse prognosis. FDG-PET/CT could have a role in the identification of patients who would benefit from more aggressive therapy, particularly if they present with LD. However, CMR is a qualitative finding. It is not clear how useful quantitative assessment of response to therapy with EORTC and PERCIST criteria is in this patient population as there was no significant difference in overall survival between the PMR, SMD and PMD groups.</p><p>Previous reports have mentioned the prognostic value of FDG-PET in patients with SCLC. Lee et&#x000a0;al<italic>.</italic><sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> reported that tumour metabolic activity as estimated by SUV<sub>max</sub> was a significant prognostic factor, capable of identifying subgroups of patients with a worse prognosis.

Patients with a negative PET scan had significantly longer survival time than patients with a positive scan</p><p>One of the main limitations of our study is the small size of the patient population. SCLC is not as frequent as NSCLC and the value of FDG-PET/CT in this indication has not been studied as extensively; and it is more difficult to conduct large prospective trials. Another important limitation is the therapeutic heterogeneity in terms of different chemotherapy regimens, combination of chemotherapy and TRT and the timing of therapy relative to PET scanning. This is a frequent pitfall in retrospective studies, probably made more acute here by the aggressiveness of SCLC and the limited efficacy of the available treatments. Despite this heterogeneity, this study reveals important findings, in particular the strong prognostic role of CMR irrespective of treatment. The available literature also seems to indicate that FDG-PET/CT may have a role in patient management for therapeutic assessment and follow-up in patients with SCLC. These findings need to be validated by a large prospective trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Perfect concordance was achieved between the EORTC and PERCIST criteria.
