Six typical carcinoids failed to reveal significant uptake on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT.

Histopathologically, they are subclassified into typical and atypical carcinoids. Typical pulmonary carcinoids, in general, have good prognosis in contrast to atypical carcinoids<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. It is important if this differentiation can be made in the preoperative stage as it has therapeutic as well as prognostic implications. To date, histopathological examination is the only means available to make this differentiation. Structural imaging findings are similar in both and differentiation between typical and atypical carcinoids is not possible. [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has been found to be of limited use in the carcinoid tumours, especially the typical ones, due to their indolent growth and low glucose turnover<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. Carcinoids express somatostatin receptors on their surface. These somatostatin receptors allow functional imaging of these tumours with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues like [<sup>68</sup>Ga]1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-<italic>N</italic><sup>I&#x02013;IIII</sup>-tetraacetic acid-(<sc>d</sc>)-Phe<sup>1</sup>-Thy<sup>3</sup>-octreotide (DOTATOC)<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>. The density of these receptors is related to the degree of the tumour differentiation, the most well-differentiated ones (i.e. typical carcinoids) expressing the highest density. This report analyses our experience with a combination of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT in 20 patients with pulmonary carcinoids to assess the possibility of differentiating the 2 histopathologic variants based on the uptake patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee for this retrospective evaluation of the patients&#x02019; records. A total of 20 patients with primary pulmonary carcinoids were assessed retrospectively. All the patients had a thorough clinical examination, haemogram, routine biochemistry, structural imaging by contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT, bronchoscopy (with biopsy), followed by surgery (except case 15). The results were analysed against the histopathologic classification (typical or atypical), which was done as per the WHO criteria by a pathologist who had more than 20 years experience in this field. The tissue diagnosis was obtained either by biopsy or histopathologic examination of the operative specimen (in the rest of the cases).</p><p>The statistical analysis was done using SPSS Statistical data editor (version 17). Due to the non-parametric nature of the data (as shown by independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test), median values of standardized uptake value (SUV)<sub>max</sub> was calculated. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney test (non-parametric test) was used to calculate the statistical differences in SUV<sub>max</sub> values of the carcinoids on both [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was taken to be significant.</p><sec><title>[<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT protocol</title><p>PET images were taken on a dedicated PET/CT scanner (Siemens Biograph 64, USA)with lutetium oxyorthosilicate (Lu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>):Ce detectors with attenuation coefficient of 0.89&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, photofraction of 30%, decay constant of 40&#x02009;ns, and the energy resolution at 511&#x02009;keV with spatial resolution of 6&#x02009;mm. After fasting for at least 4&#x02009;h, verifying the serum glucose level (which should be &#x0003c;140&#x02009;mg/dl) and with patients in a resting state, in a quiet room, a dose of 370 MBq (10&#x02009;mCi) of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG was injected intravenously. After a 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;min uptake period, CT acquisition was performed on spiral dual slice CT with a slice thickness of 4&#x02009;mm and a pitch of 1. Images were acquired using a matrix of 512&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;512 pixels and pixel size of about 1&#x02009;mm. After transmission imaging, three-dimensional PET acquisition was taken for 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;min per bed position for one or two bed positions. PET data were acquired using a matrix of 128&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;128 pixels. CT-based attenuation correction of the emission images was used.</p><p>PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method with ordered subset expectation maximization (2 iterations and 8 subsets) with a 5-mm filter. After completion of PET acquisition, the reconstructed attenuation corrected PET images, CT images and fused images of matching pairs of PET and CT images were available for review.</p></sec><sec><title>[<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT protocol</title><p>[<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT was obtained after intravenous injection of 74&#x02013;111 MBq (2&#x02013;3&#x02009;mCi) of radiotracer. During the PET/CT acquisition all PET/CT parameters were kept the same as during [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT, except for the timing of the three-dimensional PET acquisition, which was 58&#x02009;min per bed position. After the DOTATOC-PET acquisition, the reconstructed attenuation corrected PET images, CT images and fused images of matching pairs of PET and CT images were available.</p><p>A gap of at least 24&#x02009;h was given between the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT scans to ensure clearance of the radiotracer and to avoid interference between the 2 radiotracers. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians evaluated the findings independently and they were blinded to the clinical history, and the clinical and structural imaging findings.</p><p>PET images were assessed for areas of increased radiotracer uptake (visual positivity). The corresponding areas in the CT images and fused PET-CT images were corroborated. The SUV<sub>max</sub> values of the tumour tissue were calculated. For semi-quantitative analysis, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the site of the abnormal uptake in the consequent 4&#x02013;6 PET/CT slices. The slice with maximal uptake in the ROI was chosen for measurement of metabolic activity of the tracer (SUV).

The World Health Organization&#x02019;s histological classification defines them as malignant tumours of epithelial origin with growth patterns that suggest neuroendocrine differentiation. They are subclassified as typical and atypical carcinoids.</p><p>The distinction between typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids is clinically important, because it has therapeutic as well as prognostic implications. Histopathologic features favouring the diagnosis of atypical carcinoids include increased mitotic activity, pleomorphism, irregular nuclei with hyperchromatism and prominent nucleoli, areas of increased cellularity with loss of architecture and areas of necrosis within the tumour. Typical carcinoid tumours have been found to have a much better prognosis with a reported 5-year survival of 87&#x02013;100% in contrast to the atypical carcinoids, which have a reported 5-year survival rate of 25&#x02013;69%.</p><p>Pulmonary carcinoids are usually detected on structural imaging modalities like CT, which demonstrate a space-occupying lesion but do not have any specific characteristics to differentiate between the typical and atypical carcinoids.</p><p>Functional imaging has been used in the workup of carcinoids. The uptake patterns of pulmonary carcinoids on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT are variable. Rege et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> reported the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT findings in a patient with a pulmonary lesion with history of ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone secretion. The lesion was hypometabolic on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET and was found be an indolent carcinoid at histology. Erasmus et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> reported a series of 7 cases of pulmonary carcinoids of which 3 were visually negative on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET (all typical carcinoids), 3 were hypometabolic (2 typical and 1 atypical) and were erroneously categorized as benign nodules. Only 1 case (typical carcinoid) revealed visual positivity and SUV<sub>max</sub> of 6.6. Cheran et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 3 patients with pulmonary carcinoids by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET and found them to have minimal or no uptake. Most of the tumours evaluated in our study, revealed low uptake on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET. Six cases failed to reveal any significant radiotracer uptake on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT. The overall detection rate of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT in our series was 70%.</p><p>Some studies have shown that atypical carcinoids reveal high SUV<sub>max</sub> values on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET due to their aggressive nature and thus, high metabolism. Wartski et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 2 cases of pulmonary carcinoid, one typical and another atypical. The typical carcinoid demonstrated an SUV of 4.87. The atypical carcinoid revealed an SUV of 10.6 on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET. Chong et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 7 patients with bronchial carcinoid. The typical carcinoids were 3.2&#x02009;cm and 4.2&#x02009;cm in size and revealed SUV of 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG. The atypical carcinoids revealed SUVs ranging from 3.3 to 7.1 except one, which had an SUV of 1.7. Daniels et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> reviewed 16 patients with bronchial carcinoid who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET imaging. They demonstrated a trend toward higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET sensitivity for atypical carcinoid tumours (80%) compared with typical carcinoid tumours (72.7%). Kayani et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> reported that typical pulmonary carcinoids revealed lower uptake values on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT (SUV<sub>max</sub> range 1.7&#x02013;16, median SUV<sub>max</sub> 4.9) compared with atypical and other less differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (SUV<sub>max</sub> range 11.7&#x02013;20, median SUV<sub>max</sub> 16).</p><p>In our study, 6 typical carcinoids showed no significant uptake on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT and the ones that did reveal uptake were mildly positive (SUV<sub>max</sub> 2.6&#x02013;3.2). All the atypical carcinoids revealed statistically significant higher uptake on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT compared with typical carcinoids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the findings correlated well with the literature.</p><p>Carcinoid tumours are rich in somatostatin receptors (SSR), so they typically show high uptake on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT. Various studies in the literature have demonstrated the utility of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT in the evaluation of carcinoids but the literature on its use in pulmonary carcinoids is scanty. Hofmann et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 8 patients with histologically proven metastatic carcinoid tumours by [<sup>111</sup>In]octreotide scintigraphy and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT (6 abdominal and 2 bronchial). [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET could identify all lesions in 8 patients whereas [<sup>111</sup>In]octreotide identified 85% of lesions identified primarily by the morphological imaging. Koukouraki et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 15 cases of carcinoids, including 2 cases of pulmonary carcinoids using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT and reported an overall sensitivity of 68.2% and 92%, respectively. Gabriel et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> evaluated 84 cases of neuroendocrine tumours comprising 5 bronchial carcinoids using [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET. They reported a higher sensitivity for tumour detection by [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC compared with single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) or CT with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%.</p><p>The typical carcinoids have been reported to express the somatostatin receptors more abundantly compared with atypical carcinoids. Thus, it seems logical that the typical carcinoids show higher uptake of radiotracer on somatostatin receptor-based imaging studies. This was confirmed in a study by Kayani et al.<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>]</sup> who found that typical carcinoids revealed higher uptake values on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATATE (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-<italic>N</italic><sup>I</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup>II</sup>,<italic>N</italic><sup>III</sup>, <italic>N</italic><sup>IV</sup>-tetraacetic acid-(<sc>d</sc>)-Phe<sup>1</sup>-Thy<sup>3</sup>-octreotate)-PET/CT<sup>[</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>In our study, the typical carcinoids revealed higher SUV<sub>max</sub> on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT compared with atypical carcinoids (statistically significant). The only tumour that did not reveal any significant uptake was an atypical one (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>An interesting observation was made when the ratios of SUV<sub>max</sub> on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT were calculated. The ratios were significantly and uniformly higher in typical carcinoids (7.8&#x02013;30, median 17.8) compared with atypical carcinoids (0.20&#x02013;3.9, median 2.1), <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the only study that aims to co-relate the histology of pulmonary carcinoids with the uptake patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT scans and their SUV ratios. Our study tries to establish the important role that these imaging modalities can play in the management of pulmonary carcinoids. The differential uptake patterns observed in our study can be of immense help for the clinician. Although histopathologic examination by either bronchoscopy or percutaneous biopsy remains the gold standard test for confirmation, nonetheless the information provided by these non-invasive imaging modalities can substantially aid in the prediction of the histopathologic variant of carcinoids and can reliably guide the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study reveals that typical carcinoids had a lower uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG compared with the atypical carcinoids. Typical carcinoids showed higher uptake of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC compared with the atypical carcinoids. The ratio of SUV<sub>max</sub> on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT revealed higher values for typical carcinoids. The ratio of SUV<sub>max</sub> was a better predictor of the histopathologic variety of the carcinoid tumour compared with the SUV<sub>max</sub> on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTATOC-PET/CT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET/CT scans, individually. This differential uptake has potential use for preoperative assessment, possible prediction of the histology and prognostication of pulmonary carcinoids. A larger study is indicated to validate this observation and to objectively determine a cut-off value for the possible differentiation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This paper is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerimaging.org">http://www.cancerimaging.org</ext-link>.
