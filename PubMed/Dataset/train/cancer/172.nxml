Antigen-loss variants can often result, as these antigens are not critical for tumor cell survival. Exploration of functionally relevant targets has been limited. The melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to disease progression and treatment resistance. Improved understanding of the significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I&#x02013;IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00262-011-1124-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Melanoma</kwd><kwd>ML-IAP</kwd><kwd>Livin</kwd><kwd>Immune responses</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many melanoma antigens have been identified that are the targets of both cellular and humoral immune responses. The melanocyte differentiation antigens expressed in both melanomas and normal melanocytes have been extensively studied as both the targets of spontaneous immune responses as well as utilized in strategies to augment immunity with therapeutic intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, the cancer-testis antigens, such as MAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and NY-ESO-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], have been evaluated in a similar manner. Cancer-testis antigens present attractive therapeutic targets as their expression is limited to a subset of melanomas and they are not expressed in normal tissues other than the germ cells of testes, placenta, and fetal ovary. Strategies to therapeutically target these classes of antigens frequently lead to antigen-loss variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and progression of disease. An important goal in cancer therapeutics, therefore, is the identification of antigens that will less likely result in antigen-loss variants due to their essential role in melanoma pathogenesis. Some defined melanoma antigens such as &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have been linked to function. Further exploration of functionally relevant antigen targets for melanoma has potential clinical applications.</p><p>The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins represents key regulators of apoptosis that function through the prevention of caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the regulation of TNF signaling. The IAPs are frequently over expressed in a number of cancers, and their expression is increased by tumor cells in response to chemotherapy or radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Specifically, the melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is strongly expressed in a variety of human cancers including melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but has limited expression in normal adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The high expression of ML-IAP in tumors has been associated with a poor prognosis. Expression of ML-IAP has been shown to provide apoptosis resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and melanoma.</p><p>ML-IAP binds caspases 3, 7, and 9, and may function as a SMAC sink, resulting in the blockade of the death receptor and mitochondria based apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The BIR domain of ML-IAP contains an evolutionary conserved sequence that is required for its anti-apoptotic activity. In this way, ML-IAP offers melanoma cells a distinct survival advantage during tumor progression as well as a mechanism for resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The downregulation of ML-IAP in various preclinical models leads to increased apoptosis, reduced tumor cell growth, and sensitization to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>ML-IAP has previously been identified as a target of immune-mediated tumor destruction in patients receiving vaccination with autologous, irradiated melanoma cells engineered to secrete granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, spontaneous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to ML-IAP epitopes have been found in melanoma patients and a limited number of healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the current study, we utilized a library of overlapping peptides to screen for T cell responses by ELISPOT in stage I&#x02013;IV melanoma patients as well as normal donors, thus not limiting our assessment to a particular haplotype. Humoral immune responses were assessed utilizing recombinant ML-IAP protein in an ELISA. Spontaneous immune responses to ML-IAP in melanoma patients demonstrate both specific cellular and humoral activity as well as correlations with favorable clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissues and sera</title><p>Tumor and peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients on Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board approved protocols.

Treatment dramatically augmented antibody responses against ML-IAP in two patients as shown by ELISA time course and immunoblotting (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d).

Both patients experienced significant clinical benefit from treatment with stable disease or partial response for greater than 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ML-IAP is well established as a critical component for melanoma propagation and survival. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF, a known melanoma-associated oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and central regulator in melanoma, has been found to regulate ML-IAP transcription in melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, there is an increased expression of ML-IAP in primary as well as metastatic melanomas as compared to melanocytic nevi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The significance of ML-IAP to tumor cell survival is further evidenced by the induction of apoptosis through silencing RNA targeting of ML-IAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Since most cancers rely on anti-apoptotic mechanisms to propagate tumor cell growth as well as provide treatment resistance, the members of the inhibitor of apoptosis family are highly attractive to fulfill this role as functionally significant antigens. Spontaneous immune responses to anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in a variety of cancers suggest that such immunity may be a generalized event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The most studied member of the IAP family from an immune perspective is survivin, found to be the target of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and humoral immune responses in a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] as well as a tumor rejection antigen in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In comparison, humoral and cellular immune responses to ML-IAP have sporadically been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Aberrant expression of ML-IAP in lung cancer, for example, has been associated with the detection of ML-IAP-specific CTL in the peripheral blood of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Significant antibody titers to ML-IAP have also been detected in lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These reports strongly suggest the broad antigenic potential of ML-IAP in cancer.</p><p>The current report reveals spontaneous immune responses in melanoma patients to an array of ML-IAP epitopes spanning the protein&#x02019;s entire sequence. The overlapping peptide library was most sensitive for detecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. It is possible that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are present at higher precursor frequency in these patients. Additionally, MHC class II epitopes have significantly greater promiscuity for binding than class I peptides, likely contributing to this phenomenon when utilizing 18 mer peptides in our screening. This approach was nonetheless able to identify several class I epitopes including the novel HLA-A*0201 IAP237 peptide. Importantly, the broad cellular immunogenicity of ML-IAP in melanoma patients is evidenced by the significant rate of reactivity revealed in this screening involving both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> responses. The importance of ML-IAP to melanoma is highlighted by the fact that half of all melanoma patients have developed spontaneous immunity to this antigen. The presence of both cellular and humoral immune responses in individual patients suggests potential for coordination of multiple immune effector mechanisms targeting ML-IAP.</p><p>While the frequency of immune responses to ML-IAP appears higher in melanoma patients, there were detectable responses in healthy individuals. While not statistically significant, there is a trend toward greater frequency of cellular and humoral immune responses in advanced melanoma patients as compared to earlier stage or healthy individuals. In addition, spontaneous CTL responses to ML-IAP have been reported in melanoma patients as well as some healthy individuals. There may exist a hierarchy of antigens with respect to their ability to induce spontaneous immune responses in healthy individuals versus the tumor bearing host.</p><p>The ability to generate functional ML-IAP CTL that lyse targets confirms the significance of identified epitopes and relevance to the pursuit of targeting ML-IAP for therapeutic development. This ability is dependent on the presentation of naturally processed epitope on the target surface. Immunodominant HLA-A2 restricted MART-1 epitope has frequently been reported to not be presented on the surface of melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Since immunodominant epitopes can fail to be presented in some tumors, dysfunctional regulation of epitope expression in cancer cells remains a significant potential mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Inadequate epitope presentation on melanoma cell lines utilized in the current study would limit target killing by CTL, and proliferation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our detection of broad spontaneous immune responses to ML-IAP via overlapping peptides suggests that some of these epitopes can naturally be presented. One limitation in such investigation is the technical difficulty to detect ML-IAP peptides on the surface of melanoma cells. Development of such methods for peptide detection, for example mass spectrometry to identify MHC associated peptides, will likely prove insightful.</p><p>The broad immunogenicity of ML-IAP in melanoma patients further supports its importance as an immune target for therapeutic development and as a marker of disease. Three of three patients who had detectable immune responses to ML-IAP and five of six who did not have detectable immune responses exhibited significant expression of ML-IAP in their tumors (1+ or greater by immunohistochemistry). From available patient tumor samples, only one lacked expression of ML-IAP in a patient that did not exhibit detectable cellular or humoral immune responses. The degree of ML-IAP expression by immunohistochemistry and development of immune responses were not able to be directly correlated due to the small number of pathology samples available in patients whose PBMC and sera were utilized.</p><p>Ipilimumab is a fully human CTLA4 blocking antibody that is able to augment immune response against melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and has recently been demonstrated to offer a survival advantage for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The improvement in ML-IAP humoral immunity as a function of treatment not only validates ML-IAP as an antigen target, but also provides insight to the mechanism of effective antitumor immunity of CTLA-4 blockade.</p><p>Despite the high incidence of spontaneous immunity witnessed against ML-IAP in melanoma patients, these nascent responses were not sufficient to prevent the development of melanoma or its progression. One possibility for this is the concurrent induction of immune regulatory pathways that limit the antitumor efficacy of ML-IAP-specific immunity. For such cases, intervention with checkpoint blockade may provide improvement of ML-IAP effector responses. In addition, there are overlapping functions of the anti-apoptotic family members such that it may be necessary to target other critical proteins, such as survivin, XIAP, and BCL-2.</p><p>CTL from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were manufactured and functional in targeting ML-IAP. This provides the basis for vaccination and whole cell therapeutic approaches. Given its broad expression, its functional importance in tumor propagation, and high incidence of immune responses in melanoma patients, clinical investigation targeting ML-IAP is worthy of pursuit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="262_2011_1124_MOESM1_ESM.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p><bold>Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;1.</bold> T cell responses to overlapping peptide pools in stage I-IV melanoma patients by ELISPOT.
