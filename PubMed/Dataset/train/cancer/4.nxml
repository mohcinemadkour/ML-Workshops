This appears to be due to their strong but short-lived activation followed by long-term anergy after a single administration of the CD1d agonist ligand alpha-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;GC). As a promising alternative, we obtained sustained mouse iNKT cell responses associated with prolonged antitumor effects through repeated administrations of tumor-targeted recombinant sCD1d-antitumor scFv fusion proteins loaded with &#x003b1;GC. Here, we demonstrate that CD1d fusion proteins bound to tumor cells via the antibody fragment specific for a tumor-associated antigen, efficiently activate human iNKT cell lines leading to potent tumor cell lysis. The importance of CD1d tumor targeting was confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in which only the specific tumor-targeted CD1d fusion protein resulted in tumor inhibition of well-established aggressive tumor grafts. The therapeutic efficacy correlated with the repeated activation of iNKT and natural killer cells marked by their release of TH1 cytokines, despite the up-regulation of the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1. Our results demonstrate the superiority of providing the superagonist &#x003b1;GC loaded on recombinant CD1d proteins and support the use of &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-antitumor fusion proteins to secure a sustained human and mouse iNKT cell activation, while targeting their cytotoxic activity and cytokine release to the tumor site.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00262-012-1381-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>iNKT cells</kwd><kwd>CD1d</kwd><kwd>Tumor targeting</kwd><kwd>Fusion protein</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human V&#x003b1;24-invariant natural killer T lymphocytes (iNKT), and their murine counterparts V&#x003b1;14-iNKT cells, represent a particular sublineage of T lymphocytes activated by self- and microbial-derived glycolipids in the context of the monomorphic MHC-related molecule CD1d. Their importance in the transactivation of innate and adaptive immune responses has been extensively described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as well as their protective or pathological role in various conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, their antitumor activity has been well documented in a number of mouse tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and several clinical observations also indicate their protective role against cancer progression. Furthermore, low numbers and impaired proliferative capacity of iNKT cells were reported in cancer patients compared to normal donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which in some studies were correlated with poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These preclinical and clinical observations have prompted testing of iNKT cell-directed therapies, mainly through their strong activation by the synthetic glycosphingolipid CD1d ligand, alpha-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;GC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Phase I clinical trials involving the autologous transfer of &#x003b1;GC-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) were conducted in patients with different types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. No severe adverse effects were seen and the transient expansion and activation of iNKT cells, obtained in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) patients, correlated with some clinical benefit. Unfortunately, however, iNKT cell-mediated tumor immunotherapy has been limited by the short-lived cytokine response of iNKT cells to &#x003b1;GC stimulation, followed by a long-term anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recently, we have instead showed that sustained mouse iNKT cell responses could be induced by repeated stimulations with recombinant &#x003b1;GC-loaded sCD1d fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This prolonged responsiveness of iNKT cells resulted in potent antitumor activity when CD1d was targeted to the tumor site by its fusion to an anti-HER2 antitumor antibody fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the present study, recombinant CD1d proteins are shown to expand and activate human iNKT cells without the need of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Importantly, we show that human iNKT cells exhibit a potent direct cytotoxicity only against cancer cells coated with the specific sCD1d-antitumor scFv fusion protein. The importance of CD1d tumor targeting to promote sustained activation of iNKT cells and prolonged tumor inhibition is further characterized in mice in therapeutic settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice and human samples</title><p>Female mice C57BL/6J (B6) 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks old (Harlan, Zeist, Holland) were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions.

Irrespectively of whether fused or not to an antitumor scFv fragment, all sCD1d fusion proteins in solution were able to expand iNKT cell lines from freshly isolated human PBMC. The kinetics of expansion was similar to that observed following exposure to free &#x003b1;GC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), with approximately 40&#x000a0;% iNKT cells on day 7 and 60&#x000a0;% on day 14 of culture. All iNKT cell lines, whether expanded with free &#x003b1;GC or &#x003b1;GC-loaded sCD1d fusion proteins, retained the same subset composition, with a majority of DN and a minority of CD8<sup>+</sup> iNKT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Importantly, recombinant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d proteins could directly expand pure iNKT cell populations, as seen by CFSE dilution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and increased numbers of iNKT cells over 5&#x000a0;days of culture (data not shown), whereas the addition of irradiated APCs was required for free &#x003b1;GC to induce iNKT cell proliferation. These data indicate that &#x003b1;GC-loaded recombinant CD1d proteins directly trigger the semi-invariant TCR of human iNKT cells, and thus represent a promising tool for rapid and potent expansion of human iNKT cells from patients for subsequent adoptive cell transfer.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Expansion of human iNKT cell lines by &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d proteins. <bold>a</bold> PBMCs from healthy donors were stimulated with medium alone, &#x003b1;GC (100&#x000a0;ng/ml) or &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d protein (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml).

Here, we show that the killing capacity of human iNKT cells can be extended against CD1d-negative tumor cells by their coating with &#x003b1;GC/CD1d-antitumor scFv fusion proteins. Two human tumor cell lines were selected based on their expression of HER2 and/or CEA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The pancreatic tumor cell line KATO III expresses both HER2 and CEA, as shown by the binding of the specific antibodies, as well as of the corresponding sCD1d-anti-HER2 and the newly developed sCD1d-anti-CEA fusion proteins (Fig. S1). In contrast, the breast cancer cell line SKBR-3 highly expresses HER2 but is negative for CEA, which provided the possibility of evaluating targeted versus untargeted iNKT cell-mediated cytotoxicity. After 4-h incubation with iNKT cells, tumor cells were killed only when coated with the relevant sCD1d-scFv fusion proteins. Indeed, KATO III tumor cells co-expressing HER2 and CEA were killed in the presence of either of the two &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-antitumor proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, left panel), with 40 and 60&#x000a0;% of tumor cells killed at an E/T ratio of 30/1 and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 and &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA fusion proteins, respectively.

After 4-h incubation with human iNKT cells, an average of 60&#x000a0;% of SKBR3 tumor cells was apoptotic when incubated with the tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 fusion protein, while there was a similar background of tumor cell death with the untargeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA or with unstimulated iNKT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Interestingly, when instead of recombinant CD1d proteins, iNKT cells and SKBR-3 tumor cells were co-incubated with &#x003b1;GC-pulsed C1R-CD1d cells or moDCs, less than 20&#x000a0;% of SKBR3 cells became Annexin V positive (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), although the percentages of CD107a, IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;-positive iNKT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c) were similar after incubation with the tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 protein or with &#x003b1;GC/C1R-CD1d cells. The iNKT cell activation was slightly weaker in the presence of &#x003b1;GC/moDCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c), likely resulting from their hundred times lower CD1d expression than the C1R-CD1d transfectant. In addition, the state of activation of iNKT cells incubated with the &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA did not differ from unstimulated iNKT cells (Fig. S2). In conclusion, the similar percentages of activated iNKT cells stimulated by &#x003b1;GC-pulsed APCs or by tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 protein did not correlate with a similar killing of SKBR3 tumor cells, but rather with the concomitant elimination of the &#x003b1;GC/APCs, as shown by, respectively, 26 and 36&#x000a0;% of Annexin V<sup>+</sup> &#x003b1;GC/C1R-CD1d and &#x003b1;GC/moDCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Altogether, these data further confirmed the requirement of CD1d on the surface of the target cell for efficient killing, whether naturally expressed on the surface or bound via its fusion to an antitumor scFv fragment. The activation of iNKT cells by tumor-targeted CD1d molecules was also evidenced by their cytokine content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Indeed, in the presence of SKBR3 tumor cells coated with &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2, about half of iNKT cells was positive for TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3;, while no intracellular cytokines were detected in the presence of the irrelevant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA fusion protein. Altogether, these results support the relevance of sCD1d-antitumor fusion proteins for cancer therapy, as seen by the strong activation of human iNKT cells, revealed by direct tumor cytotoxicity and cytokine release.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Activated iNKT cells kill &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-loaded tumor cells as well as CD1d-positive APCs. <bold>a</bold> Apoptosis of SKBR3 tumor cells or APCs after 4-h incubation with iNKT cell clones, in the presence of &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-CEA, &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-HER2, &#x003b1;GC-pulsed C1R-CD1d cells, or &#x003b1;GC-pulsed moDCs.

Mice with established tumors (&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup>) were treated either with &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA fusion protein (Fig. S1), &#x003b1;GC alone, untargeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d or &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 fusion proteins. After a total of six injections given over 3&#x000a0;weeks, all mice treated with &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA protein retained small tumors barely exceeding 200&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup>, and hence 60&#x000a0;% smaller than in untreated animals (700&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). In marked contrast, &#x003b1;GC alone and untargeted sCD1d were unable to inhibit tumor growth. The requirement of tumor-targeted CD1d treatment to achieve a therapeutic effect was best demonstrated in the mice treated with the irrelevant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 fusion protein, as all animals had fast tumor growth. The prolonged reactivity of iNKT cells was tested in the spleen by the detection of ex vivo IFN&#x003b3; production 1&#x000a0;h after the sixth injection. After repeated injections of &#x003b1;GC, only few iNKT cells still produced IFN&#x003b3;, confirming the induction of anergy upon repetitive stimulations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, no significant IFN&#x003b3; was detected after untargeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d and irrelevant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 treatments, though in this case likely resulting from a weak activation of iNKT cells rather than anergy. In contrast, 15&#x000a0;% of spleen iNKT cells isolated from mice treated with tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA were positive for IFN&#x003b3;, which correlated with the fact that antitumor activity was exclusively obtained in this group. Although tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells were too few to be functionally analyzed, the prolonged reactivity of iNKT cells only in the spleens of mice treated with tumor-targeted fusion protein suggested that these cells had been repeatedly activated at the tumor site. In view of previous studies that attributed &#x003b1;GC-induced iNKT cell anergy to the up-regulation of the co-inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], we tested its expression level on spleen iNKT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Strikingly, PD-1 expression was up-regulated not only on the vast majority of iNKT cells after six injections of &#x003b1;GC alone, but also after repeated injections of recombinant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d proteins, including iNKT cells activated by the tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Therefore, increased PD-1 expression did not correlate with the state of unresponsiveness of iNKT cells. At this point, it is interesting to mention that the majority of human iNKT cells were found positive for PD-1 expression when analyzed ex vivo in normal donor PBMCs (Fig. S3), likely resulting from previous in vivo stimulations. These observations suggest that PD-1 up-regulation on mouse and human iNKT cells is rather a marker of activation and is not in itself sufficient to mediate iNKT cell anergy.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>In vivo antitumor activity of &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA fusion protein. <bold>a</bold> Mice were grafted s.c. with 7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>5</sup> MC38-CEA tumor cells.

In view of their fast transactivation by iNKT cells, NK cells were tested in the same groups of mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). After three injections of &#x003b1;GC, spleen NK cells also failed to produce IFN&#x003b3;, as a consequence of iNKT cell anergy. In contrast, in mice treated with either &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA or &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 fusion proteins, NK cells remained reactive, as seen by increased IFN&#x003b3; production. The repeated activation of NK cells upon treatment with the irrelevant fusion protein &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 indicated that sustained systemic activation of iNKT cells had occurred, although to a weaker extent than with the tumor-targeted treatment. Serum cytokines measured 1&#x000a0;h after the third injection also reflected the prolonged reactivity of iNKT cells to tumor-targeted recombinant CD1d proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), as shown by significant serum levels of IFN&#x003b3; and IL-4 in mice treated with &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-CEA protein, while barely any cytokines could be measured after three injections of &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-anti-HER2 protein.

The attractiveness of this strategy resides in two main beneficial characteristics. First, recombinant CD1d proteins have the capacity to keep iNKT cells reactive through multiple stimulations, in contrast to their unresponsiveness after repeated challenge by &#x003b1;GC-loaded APCs. Second, the targeting of CD1d molecules to cancer cells by their fusion to an antitumor scFv fragment efficiently redirects activated iNKT cells to the tumor site, promoting a local innate immune response, including direct lysis of targeted tumors by iNKT cells, release of large amounts of cytokines and transactivation of NK cells, altogether leading to prolonged antitumor effects.</p><p>So far, the therapeutic use of iNKT cells has been limited by their short-lived cytokine response to &#x003b1;GC stimulation, followed by a long-term anergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of iNKT cell unresponsiveness, and the controversial results suggest that multiple factors are likely involved. At first, the fast and long-term up-regulation of PD-1 upon activation of iNKT cells was proposed as the main mechanism since their anergic state could be prevented or reverted by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and did not occur in PD-1 KO mice [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]]. However, the exclusive role of PD-1 in the control of iNKT cell anergy was not confirmed in all systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and the involvement of co-stimulation through CD28 or co-inhibitory receptors such as BTLA was suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this respect, our present results also demonstrated the strong and long-term up-regulation of PD-1 upon activation of murine iNKT cells, which however did not correlate with the state of anergy. Indeed, iNKT cells remained reactive to multiple injections of recombinant CD1d fusion proteins despite similar up-regulation of PD-1 as was found on anergic iNKT cells after treatment with &#x003b1;GC as a free drug. Clinical trials in cancer patients have preferred the autologous transfer of &#x003b1;GC-pulsed DC, which showed prolonged iNKT cell activation, as compared to the glycolipid alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, a maximum of two subsequent rounds of iNKT cell stimulations were seen despite three to four autologous transfers of &#x003b1;GC-pulsed DC in some studies, suggesting that iNKT cells became progressively unresponsive to further challenge. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments with human iNKT cells do not allow monitoring the induction of anergy by &#x003b1;GC, likely due to the presence of IL-2 required for the maintenance of human and mouse iNKT cells in vitro. Indeed, IL-2 has been shown to prevent or revert the state of anergy of murine iNKT cells both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, it is interesting to note that around 70&#x000a0;% of human iNKT cells were already expressing PD-1 when tested ex vivo on total PBMC from healthy donors, probably resulting from previous in vivo antigen stimulations. Since it is unlikely that the large majority of iNKT cells present in normal donors are anergic, the expression of PD-1 on activated human and mouse iNKT cells is probably not sufficient to mediate iNKT cell unresponsiveness. So far, the exact mechanism that mediates the &#x003b1;GC-induced anergy of iNKT cells or, conversely, their prolonged reactivity to recombinant &#x003b1;GC/CD1d fusion proteins remains unclear.</p><p>Importantly, our data demonstrated a direct activation of human iNKT cells by recombinant soluble CD1d proteins in the absence of any APC, which excluded the possibility of loss of &#x003b1;GC from the recombinant CD1d proteins and its loading onto endogenous CD1d expressed by APCs. In this regard, the capacity of a monomeric CD1d molecule to activate iNKT cells seems to be unique to this antigen-presenting molecule, as soluble MHC Class I and Class II monomers were shown to be unable to activate antigen-specific T cells, in contrast to dimeric and multimeric forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The question remains whether the iNKT cell activation by monomeric &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d proteins is peculiar to the strong agonist &#x003b1;GC and whether it would not occur with a more physiological CD1d ligand. Nevertheless, activation of human iNKT cells by soluble &#x003b1;GC/CD1d proteins remained significantly less efficient than plastic-coated or tumor bound CD1d fusion proteins and &#x003b1;GC-pulsed APCs, which likely resulted from the lack of molecular CD1d aggregation in the absence of plastic or cell surface, as well as from the absence of co-stimulation. In support of this, systemic treatments of mice with untargeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d or irrelevant &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-scFv fusion proteins led to a two to threefold weaker release of cytokines, as compared to treatment with the tumor-targeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-scFv protein. Rather than a drawback, the lower potency of soluble monomeric CD1d molecules will be rather favorable in limiting a potentially detrimental systemic activation of iNKT cells, while promoting their sustained activation when targeted at the tumor site.</p><p>The second attractive characteristic of our immunotherapy strategy is the targeting of recombinant CD1d fusion proteins to tumors by fusion of the extracellular part of CD1d to an antibody scFv fragment specific for a tumor antigen. Indeed, the present data show both in vitro with human iNKT cell clones and in vivo in a therapeutic mouse tumor model that the strongest tumor inhibition is obtained with tumor-targeted recombinant sCD1d-antitumor scFv fusion protein as compared to an irrelevant sCD1d fusion protein. This finding fits with the prerequisite of CD1d expression by tumors to promote efficient iNKT cell-mediated killing, which has been previously reported in humans in the context of CD1d-expressing lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and in mice with tumor models transfected with CD1d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this context, our strategy using CD1d-antitumor scFv fusion proteins opens the possibility to target CD1d-negative tumors and render them susceptible to iNKT cell attack. The effectiveness of this approach was best demonstrated by the direct cytotoxicity of human iNKT cell clones against tumor cells when coated with the &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-scFv fusion protein specific for the tumor antigen expressed on their surface, while the untargeted &#x003b1;GC/sCD1d-scFv was unable to induce antitumor cytotoxic activity. More importantly, although iNKT cells were strongly activated by &#x003b1;GC-pulsed APCs, such as C1R-CD1d or moDCs, as seen by CD107a expression and cytokine release, they rather killed the APCs and to a lesser extent the tumor cells, indicating that bystander killing by iNKT cells was inferior to the CD1d-mediated cytotoxicity. These observations suggest that the strategy of iNKT cell activation by autologous transfer of &#x003b1;GC-pulsed DCs, as tested so far in clinical trials, may direct the intrinsic cytotoxic activity of iNKT cells preferentially against the transferred DCs and not against tumors. Because of the relatively low numbers of peripheral iNKT cells in humans, this aspect was probably not a major issue, and these protocols of DC transfer have instead successfully induced the immunomodulatory functions of iNKT cells, such as the transactivation of NK and T cells. However, our results in mice demonstrated that the stronger iNKT cell activation by tumor-targeted sCD1d treatment also led to higher NK cell activation, which are known to greatly participate in tumor inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the targeting of CD1d molecules to the tumor site not only triggers iNKT-mediated tumor lysis, but also favors local innate and adaptive antitumor responses, as suggested by the accumulation of iNKT, NK, and T cells at the tumor site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The importance of tumor targeting and local activation of iNKT cells was underlined by recent clinical trials in which &#x003b1;GC-pulsed DC and/or ex vivo expanded iNKT cells were delivered in the vicinity of the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The best clinical results were obtained in HNSCC patients in whom &#x003b1;GC-pulsed DCs were administered via the nasal submucosa and iNKT cells via the tumor-feeding arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition to the local delivery of iNKT cells, this encouraging clinical benefit also demonstrated the need to increase the numbers of iNKT cells by autologous transfer of in vitro expanded iNKT cell lines, since the frequency of iNKT cells is often very low or even undetectable in advanced cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To this aim, recombinant sCD1d-antitumor fusion proteins appear as promising tools: first, in vitro to expand large numbers of human iNKT cells for adoptive transfer, and second, in vivo to redirect these transferred iNKT cells to the tumor site.</p><p>Finally, the efficient tumor targeting of CD1d molecules requires the over-expression of a tumor antigen for which a high-affinity antibody scFv has been developed. So far, we have used two of the highest affinity existing scFv fragments specific for the HER2 and CEA, which are often over-expressed, respectively, in breast cancers and gastric cancers. As alternatives to tumor-associated markers, antigens over-expressed in the tumor stroma and/or neo-vessels would be additional good candidates for the targeting of CD1d molecules to the tumor site.</p><p>In conclusion, the present results propose and support monomeric CD1d-scFv antitumor fusion proteins as a potent tool to effectively harness iNKT cells against cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="262_2012_1381_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 337&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The financial support for this study was provided by the Swiss Cancer League OCS-02248-08-2008 (S.
