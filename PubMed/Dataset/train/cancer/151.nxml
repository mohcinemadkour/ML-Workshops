Patients with a known secondary carcinoma were excluded. Diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT was available in all patients (together with PET or in a separate setting with the same acquisition parameters).</p><p>The CT and FDG PET reports were examined for all patients. In discordant cases, images of both modalities were re-evaluated by a radiologist and a specialist in nuclear medicine separately.</p><p>All results were verified with histological findings or imaging and/or clinical follow-up studies for at least six months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the preoperative setting, additional FDG PET had an influence on the staging in 11 (11/28) patients (39%) comparing to CT alone:</p><p>Nine (9/28) patients (32%) were downstaged, 6 of them with suspicious organ metastases, 3 patients with suspicious lymph node metastases and 1 patient with both suspicious organ metastases and lymph nodes metastases on CT.</p><p>Two (2/28) patients (7%) were upstaged by FDG PET/CT, one of them with an unclear lung lesion on CT and a malignant hilar lymph node. The second patient showed peritoneal carcinosis on FDG PET.</p><p>Comparing with stand-alone CT, only 3 (3/42) patients (7%) from the restaging and follow-up group were downstaged by additional FDG PET, while concordant findings were seen on both imaging modalities for the rest of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study clearly showed that for primary staging of distant metastases in colon cancer patients FDG PET/CT is more advantageous and overcomes the lower specificity of CT alone.</p><p>Comparing both modalities in postoperative cases, FDG PET provides additional findings only in few cases.</p></sec></body></article>
