Most of our present imaging devices were developed for imaging of the thyroid and thyroid cancer. Millions of patients in over 100 countries have been diagnosed and treated for thyroid cancer using nuclear medicine techniques. It remains, however, one of the most dynamic areas of development in nuclear medicine with new roles for positron emission tomography and receptor based imaging. In addition to this is research into combinations of genetic therapy and radioisotopes and receptor based therapy using beta emitting analogues of somatostatin. Despite the use of ultrasound computed tomography and magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine techniques remain central to both imaging and therapy in thyroid disease and the field has recently become one of the most dynamic within the specialty.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Thyroid disease</kwd><kwd><sup>131</sup>I</kwd><kwd>somatostatin receptor imaging and therapy</kwd><kwd>PET</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), though not the commonest of cancers, remains one of the cancers that we are keen to identify, stage and treat as even in its most advanced state cures though unlikely are possible.

However, most large centres performing isotopic thyroid studies will find 1&#x02013;2 incidental thyroid cancers a year on the pre-treatment scan performed on patients with hyperthyroidism using <sup>123</sup>I or <sup>99m</sup>Tc pertechnetate. These cancers will appear as a cold nodule but this appearance is very non-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). A cold nodule on a functional thyroid scan is normally benign with reported rates of malignancy varying from 5 to 20%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>. So whilst it requires further investigation often ultrasound will suffice as these cold nodules are normally cysts.

This often seems a paradox. How is it that thyroid cancer is negative on a diagnostic thyroid cell but positive on a whole body <sup>131</sup>I scan? The reason is that the whole body <sup>131</sup>I images are performed 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;h after administration of the radiotracer allowing cells with poor uptake, e.g. cancer cells enough time to accumulate the radioiodine. When performing local imaging, the non-cancerous normal thyroid cells take up the radioiodine or pertechnetate at a much higher rate so the cancer appears as a defect.</p></sec><sec><title><sup>131</sup>I whole body imaging</title><p>The standard methods for imaging patients with differentiated thyroid cancer is to perform whole body imaging with <sup>131</sup>I. This has normally been done with a small &#x02018;tracer dose&#x02019; of about 150&#x02013;185 MBq of <sup>131</sup>I given orally and then imaged 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;h later. To ensure good uptake of the <sup>131</sup>I the patient should be prepared by withdrawal of thyroid replacement therapy (4 weeks is required for thyroxine) and the patient is often asked to take a low iodine diet avoiding fish and other sea foods. The count rates obtained from <sup>131</sup>I imaging are often poor and images less than ideal quality. This is partly due to the fact that <sup>131</sup>I gives off a variety of different gamma rays with different energies resulting in scatter but the high energy gamma photons up to 580&#x02009;keV need a high energy collimator which blocks about 95% of the counts coming from the patient. In such circumstance the administered activity of the radiopharmaceutical would be increased however, it is normal practice when there is any evidence of residual thyroid tissue or cancer to give a therapeutic dose of <sup>131</sup>I within 2&#x02013;3 days. This is done so that the patient does not need to withdraw from thyroid replacement again. There is now clear evidence that administration of too high an activity of <sup>131</sup>I given for imaging damages the thyroid cancer cells in such away that they have reduced uptake of the therapeutic dose of <sup>131</sup>I in up to 80% of cases; a process known as stunning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. There is some evidence that stunning may occur with activities of <sup>131</sup>I as low as 74 MBq at which point image quality is very poor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>.</p><p>An alternative approach has been to assume that all patients post thyroidectomy will need <sup>131</sup>I ablation and plan to give a 3 GBq ablative activity 6 weeks after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) withdrawing lio-thyronine 2 weeks before therapy. If there is no uptake on the post therapy scan no more <sup>131</sup>I is given; however, if there is activity then treatment with 5 GBq of <sup>131</sup>I is given until the post therapy scan is clear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Whilst there is some concern that the patient may receive an unnecessary radiation dose, it has also been suggested that a dose of <sup>131</sup>I given when the subsequent scan is negative may be treating sub-1&#x02009;cm tumours not visible on the scan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Once the patient is ablated they can be followed by plasma levels of thyroglobulin.

There is at present no consensus on when and how newer contrast agents with faster clearance can be used. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of neck, spin and liver and ultrasound of liver and neck and bone scintigraphy are often performed. These other techniques tend to be used when there is evidence of disease not seen on the <sup>131</sup>I scan or confirm the site of abnormality seen on the <sup>131</sup>I scan.</p></sec><sec><title>Ablative therapy</title><p>The aim of ablative therapy is to remove all thyroidal tissue both benign and malignant so that the patient can be followed by serial plasma thyroglobulin levels. Data from over 40 years show that in all but stage 1 tumours there is a progression and overall survival benefit from ablation but this is only apparent 10&#x02013;25 years after surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. There is, however, some discussion on the activity of <sup>131</sup>I needed for ablation with some observers stating that this could be achieved with activities much lower than the standard 3 GBq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. To attempt to answer this question, the British National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) Head and Neck group have facilitated a national prospective randomized controlled trial comparing high and low activity ablative doses of <sup>131</sup>I. It is hoped that this study called the &#x02018;HiLo&#x02019; study will report in 2009&#x02013;2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant TSH/transgenic changes</title><p>To ensure adequate uptake of <sup>131</sup>I into tumour cells that often have reduced iodine trapping it is necessary to remove any competition for the cell membrane sodium iodide symporter (NIS). Some variants such as Hurtle cell tumour have poor uptake of radioiodine in almost all cases. Therefore excess iodine (the most common source being CT contrast) should be avoided for at least 6 months. In addition the cells need to be stimulated by high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) The normal method to do this and obviously the cheapest is withdrawal of thyroid replacement therapy started after thyroidectomy for at least 4 weeks. Though it may be possible to cover the first 2 weeks of this withdrawal with lio-thyronine, the aim of the exercise is to make the patient profoundly hypothyroid. This can be very unpleasant and for the more elderly patient with cardiac disease it can lead to a significant cardiac event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Uptake of <sup>131</sup>I can also be assisted by administration of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) which induces additional TSH release from the pituitary 30&#x02013;60&#x02009;min before giving the <sup>131</sup>I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>.</p><p>More recently recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) has become available and pre-administration 48 and 24&#x02009;h before giving the radiotracer can result in similar uptake of <sup>131</sup>I into the tumour tissues as 4 weeks of thyroxine withdrawal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. There are clear advantages that the patient does not have to have the symptoms of hypothyroidism or the cardiac risks. The only significant drawback is that the treatment costs about &#x000a3;1000 (&#x020ac;1500).</p><p>In some patients there may be very poor or little uptake of radioiodine. This could be because the cells no longer express the NIS gene. This is probably a defensive mechanism for cells exposed to non-lethal levels of radioiodine and those that survive may be those that do not take up the radioactive tracer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>. There is some evidence, however, that the NIS gene expression can be stimulated by pre-medication with lithium or retinoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref> but so far there remains no clear consensus on their use and they have not entered general usage. In addition to this, there is some interesting pre-clinical work looking at viral vectors to try and re-transfect these cells with the NIS gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. Whether or not any of this technology will find a clinical role remains unclear. In addition, the use of NIS gene transfection may in itself increase tumour retention of <sup>131</sup>I and this requires organification which is controlled by a different gene.</p></sec><sec><title><sup>123</sup>I</title><p>As the main role for whole body imaging is to determine if there is sufficient thyroid tissue to need further ablation by <sup>131</sup>I, it may be possible to use an isotope of iodine without beta emission and therefore reduce the risk of blunting. <sup>123</sup>I, a cyclotron produced isotope of iodine with a 13-h half life and a pure gamma emission photon of 167&#x02009;keV has been used for thyroid imaging for over 25 years. However, recently it has also been introduced for whole body imaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. As there are no beta or high energy gamma emissions, there is improved dosimetry, which means that sufficient <sup>123</sup>I (about 100 MBq) can be administered to ensure a good count rate at 24&#x02009;h. This can improve image quality as well as prevent stunning. As most gamma cameras are optimized for lower energy isotopes, such as <sup>99m</sup>Tc, single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) is often easier with <sup>123</sup>I than <sup>131</sup>I as a higher count rate can be achieved and SPECT is very count dependent. This should improve the accuracy of the imaging further. The advantages of <sup>123</sup>I are such that in our practice we no longer perform <sup>131</sup>I whole body images pre-<sup>131</sup>I therapy. Like <sup>131</sup>I, imaging with <sup>123</sup>I can be enhanced by pre-administration of rhTSH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. The disadvantage is cost as <sup>123</sup>I is up to 5 times greater in price than <sup>131</sup>I.</p></sec><sec><title>Positron emission tomography (PET)</title><p>Despite the advances in imaging that are obtained with use of <sup>123</sup>I, there will be a cohort of patients in whom there is biochemical evidence of residual thyroid cancer by a raised and rising thyroglobulin level but no active disease can be found by <sup>131</sup>I whole body imaging. If CT and MR are unhelpful then [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET) has been used. One advantage of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET is that as it reflects tumour metabolism and not iodine uptake, thyroid replacement hormones do not need to be stopped though recent evidence suggests that enhanced uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG can occur as the TSH is elevated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. The use of rhTSH pre [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET is being investigated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>.</p><p>Using PET-CT it is possible to not only identify any abnormal sites of activity suggestive of metastatic disease but to localize the site of any abnormality which will aid biopsy, surgery or radiotherapy and these tumours tend to be chemo-resistant and only local treatments are effective. Though few studies have been performed, the accuracy of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG in thyroid cancer is as high as 95% and in particular for those tumours that have de-differentiated and are therefore <sup>123</sup>I/<sup>131</sup>I negative<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">24&#x02013;28</xref>. Incidentally, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET-CT can also be used in anaplastic thyroid cancer but its clinical utility is doubtful in view of the dismal prognosis of the anaplastic variant.</p><p>It may also be possible to use <sup>124</sup>I, a positron emitter, but there is as yet little evidence that this is not just a more expensive way to image with radioiodine and no clear clinical advantage has been shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>.</p><p>A footnote to the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET story in thyroid cancer is that both benign and malignant growths can be very glucose avid. As a consequence as more patients undergo [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging for other disease, serendipitous uptake in the thyroid may be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These should be investigated. It is difficult to know how many such nodules are seen on PET but last year we found 2 previously unknown thyroid cancers in the 500 patients we sent for [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging so a big centre performing 2500 PET scans a year can expect to find approximately 10 previously unknown thyroid cancers. In addition to this will be the occasional cancer metastases in the thyroid and thyroid lymphoma. All this means that all sites of unexpected thyroid uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG must be fully investigated.

Therefore other simple single photons techniques have been developed and used historically in assessment of thyroid cancers. As thyroid cancers tend to have a higher metabolic turnover than normal tissues tracers such as [<sup>201</sup>Tl]- and [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]sestamibi have been used in two scenarios. First, scintigraphic assessment of the cold nodule. If a thyroid cold nodule has uptake of [<sup>201</sup>Tl]- or [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]sestamibi, the chance of malignancy rises from 5% to 60%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>. Also it was used in finding tumours in the scenario of raised thyroglobulin and negative <sup>131</sup>I scan but has really been superseded by PET techniques.</p><p>There may still, however. be a role for <sup>67</sup>Ga citrate in identification of thyroid lymphoma where diffuse uptake throughout the gland is diagnostic, though this is more likely to be a finding in a patient imaged for another reason such as fever of unknown cause.</p></sec><sec><title>Somatostatin imaging</title><p>Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide have been used to treat the symptoms of neuroendocrine tumours for 15 years and a radiolabelled form, [<sup>111</sup>In]pentetreotide has been used for imaging of neuroendocrine tumours such as carcinoid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. However, it was found that there was uptake in a range of other cancers which had expression of the sub-type-2 receptor for which pentetreotide has a very high affinity. A series of studies have been performed showing that 74% of differentiated thyroid cancers have uptake of [<sup>111</sup>In]pentetreotide including some negative on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. This was found to be true for those tumours with and without uptake of <sup>131</sup>I so could be used as an alternative to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging. There are, however, disadvantages in using somatostatin imaging in that uptake depends on receptor expression; the resolution is not as good as PET and the cost can be higher.

A therapeutic version of (DMSA(V)) using <sup>186</sup>Re or <sup>188</sup>Re is under development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET-CT has been used increasingly in metastatic MCT but at present there is insufficient data to state if it will be used instead of the established nuclear medicine techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the past 60 years nuclear medicine has been at the heart of diagnosis and treatment of patients with thyroid cancers. Methods of imaging have been refined as have optimal protocols for therapy. Newer techniques such as PET and receptor based imaging and therapy has meant that this oldest branch of nuclear medicine has also become one of its fastest moving.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><article-title>AACE/AME Task Force on Thyroid Nodules American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi.
