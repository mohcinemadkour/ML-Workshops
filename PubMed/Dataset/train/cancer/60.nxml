We assessed whether an effective protocol for ex vivo T-cell expansion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), suitable for ACT of both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients, could be identified. PBMCs from both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients were stimulated in vitro with autologous, irradiated melanoma cells (mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture; MLTCs) in the presence of IL-2 and IL-15 followed by the rapid expansion protocol (REP). The functional activity of these T lymphocytes was characterized and compared with that of TILs. In addition, the immune infiltration in vivo of ocular melanoma lesions was analyzed. An efficient in vitro MLTC expansion of melanoma reactive T cells was achieved from all PBMC&#x02019;s samples obtained in 7 cutaneous and ocular metastatic melanoma patients. Large numbers of melanoma-specific T cells could be obtained when the REP protocol was applied to these MLTCs. Most MLTCs were enriched in non-terminally differentiated T<sub>EM</sub> cells homogeneously expressing co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., NKG2D, CD28, CD134, CD137). A similar pattern of anti-tumor activity, in association with a more variable expression of co-stimulatory molecules, was detected on short-term in vitro cultured TILs isolated from the same patients. In these ocular melanoma patients, we observed an immune infiltrate with suppressive characteristics and a low rate of ex vivo growing TILs (28.5% of our cases). Our MLTC protocol overcomes this limitation, allowing the isolation of T lymphocytes with effector functions even in these patients. Thus, anti-tumor circulating PBMC-derived T cells could be efficiently isolated from melanoma patients by our novel ex vivo enrichment protocol. This protocol appears suitable for ACT studies of cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00262-011-1179-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cutaneous melanoma</kwd><kwd>Ocular melanoma</kwd><kwd>T-cell responses</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The incidence of melanoma has increased over the past three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, this tumor is resistant to standard therapies with a life expectancy of less then 1&#x000a0;year for metastatic melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Tough new targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and immunotherapy trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], however, suggest that survival of melanoma patients may be considerably improved in the near future. Ocular melanoma, though infrequent, is a very aggressive disease with a dismal prognosis since 50% of patients die from metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Notably, the biological and molecular profiles of ocular melanoma showed relevant differences compared to cutaneous melanoma, with the first type of tumor commonly developing liver metastasis. For example, the mutated BRAF, which is detected in up to 62% of cutaneous melanoma and represents a novel target molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is rarely found in ocular melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the eye has been considered an &#x0201c;immune privileged&#x0201d; site maintained by a variety of immune suppressive mechanisms (e.g., TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-10, immune cells with negative regulatory functions) that can sustain the development of ocular tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, immunogenic intraocular tumors leading to the immune-mediated rejection have been documented in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been reported that the presence of either tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) is associated with poor prognosis in uveal melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, it remains to be ascertained if immune stimulation may favor or control the progression of ocular tumors. In fact, it has been shown in cutaneous melanoma that tumor cells can produce immuno-modulating factors, which exhaust or block the immune response and recruit immune cells with negative regulatory activity (T regulatory cells, Tregs; myeloid-derived suppressor cells, MDSCs; suppressive macrophages, M2) to a specific site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, immunotherapeutic protocols that can modify and rescue anti-tumor immune responses need to be designed for both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients.</p><p>Different active strategies have been used to induce anti-tumor immunity in cancer patients mainly based on the targeting of a variety of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by active therapy (vaccination) with peptide, protein or DNA/RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These vaccination strategies, while increasing systemic anti-tumor immune responses, resulted in limited clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], though a recently performed peptide-based phase II vaccination trial documented an increase in the median overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, the adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) can overcome the suppressive tumor milieu by using immune cells with cancer specificity grown outside of the patient and infused in large numbers following pre-conditioning by chemotherapy, alone or in combination with patient total body irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>ACT with TILs isolated from metastatic melanoma lesions led to objective tumor regression in 49&#x02013;72% of patients with many long-term sustained responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, TILs can be exploited for ACT studies only in melanoma patients with resectable tumors and from which T cells can be expanded ex vivo (approximately 60&#x02013;70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent published analysis identified the parameters, such as age, sex and the type of systemic therapy, that can negatively influence the ex vivo expansion of TILs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The persistence in vivo of the infused T cells was highly associated with clinical responses. The in vivo effectiveness of TILs was also associated with the differentiation state of the T cells, telomere length and CD27 expression, factors that are relevant for specific anti-tumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). These results have been confirmed in a phase II clinical study showing high frequency of objective regressions in metastatic melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>An alternative approach has been explored for patients without resectable lesions or with low number of TILs using autologous lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood genetically modified with genes encoding for anti-tumor T-cell receptors (TCRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These studies showed encouraging clinical responses by using T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for differentiating (Melan-A/MART-1, CEA) or cancer testis (MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1) antigens, which could be applied to tumors having different histological origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This strategy however permits the targeting of only a single tumor antigen by the engineered T lymphocytes with the risk of tumor variants selection. Further efforts are therefore needed to develop ACT protocols, which employ the use of T lymphocytes with the ability to target a wider range of tumors and have a greater potential of tumor site migration. This would result in treatment for a larger number of cancer patients.</p><p>To this aim, we characterized anti-melanoma immune responses of T cells isolated both from the peripheral blood and from the TILs of cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients. As a result, we identified a new protocol that allows for the in vitro enrichment and expansion in large scale of T lymphocytes obtained from PBMCs, which were compared to those obtained with TILs. Furthermore, this protocol benefits from the stimulation with the autologous tumor cells, which in turn leads to the selection of T cells directed against multiple TAAs. Therefore, this protocol would be suitable for ACT clinical studies in the vast majority of both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients particularly when TILs are not available.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines, PBMCs and TILs</title><p>Melanoma cell lines were established in vitro from surgically resectable tumor lesions from both cutaneous (#1061, 1067, 2710, 4478D, 49318, 0342, 25368 and 7 mel) and ocular (#2130, 4330, 4022, 1141, 37165, 48409 and 15765) melanoma patients.

The evidence that the recognition of the Melan-A/MART-1-derived epitope by this MLTC was weaker than the autologous and the allogeneic 501 mel tumor lines (121 vs. 285 and 272&#x000a0;N. spots/5,000 cells, respectively; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) suggests that these T lymphocytes can exhibit specific recognition of a broad panel of TAAs expressed by tumor cells. On the contrary, no recognition of a panel of HLA-A1-restricted peptides (MAG3-A1, MAGE-A3 and COA-1) was observed for the MLTC of patient #4478D (data not shown). In fact, only for patient #0342, the MLTC-derived T lymphocytes recognized the HLA-A1-restricted MAGE-A3 antigen (data not shown).

Most of these T lymphocyte cultures recognized a broad array of TAAs, probably including also unknown antigens, since only in limited cases (#2710, 0342), the recognition of molecularly defined epitopes was observed. The specificity of anti-tumor reactivity by the isolated MLTCs was corroborated by the lack of the reactivity of HLA-mismatched melanoma lines (49318 mel in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and of the NK target line K562.</p><p>We were able to establish in vitro primary uveal melanoma lines with efficiencies approaching 57% (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8 tumor cell lines out 12 primary and 2 metastatic ocular tumor samples).

We found that the immune profile of these ocular melanoma cell lines was similar to that of cutaneous melanoma counterparts as described in the supplements and Tables&#x000a0;1S and 2S (available online).

This protocol appears then to be suitable for ACT clinical applications for cutaneous and, for the first time, for ocular melanoma patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ACT represents a promising therapeutic approach for metastatic melanoma. In fact, the infusion in metastatic patients of autologous TILs has led to significant responses in a high number of clinical cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A multicenter confirmatory trial has been proposed to show that this complex technique of ex vivo expansion of TILs can be applied by multiple institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, a simplified protocol for the isolation and the growth in vitro of TILs has been set up to improve both the efficiency of isolation of these T lymphocytes and their anti-tumor potential for ACT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, some features such as age, sex, tumor location and any prior systemic therapy of patients can affect the success in TIL isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to identify an alternatively protocol, when TILs are not available, which involves the isolation of polyclonal anti-melanoma T lymphocytes from the PBMCs of both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients. We have successfully and reproducibly (7/7 patients) isolated anti-tumor circulating T cells by the stimulation in vitro of PBMCs with irradiated autologous tumor cells (MLTCs; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and also Figure&#x000a0;1S of supplementary online data). The MLTCs cultures isolated in vitro corresponded to non-terminally differentiated T<sub>EM</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] expressing high levels of co-stimulatory molecules, a subpopulation of T cells that can exhibit efficient melanoma-specific reactivity and in vivo persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In few cases (2/6), we could also molecularly identify the TAAs (Melan-A/MART-1 and MAGE-A3) recognized by the tumor-specific MLTC T cells. Nevertheless, the cytokine release in the presence of the autologous tumor recognition was higher compared to the TAA-directed reactivity, suggesting that our protocol can achieve an ex vivo enrichment of T lymphocytes reacting to multiple TAAs, thus avoiding the selection of tumor immune variants. Along this line, it has been documented that TILs, reactive with a broad array of TAAs, isolated from melanoma patients can be successfully exploited for ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], possibly targeting the heterogeneity of tumor cells.</p><p>Very little information is available on the immune-mediated control of ocular melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in addition, this aggressive disease has limited therapeutic options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, immunotherapy-based treatment, as ACT, can represent a promising approach for the control of this disease. Interestingly, the application of our MLTC-based protocol has led to the isolation ex vivo of tumor reactive T cells from one ocular metastatic melanoma patient (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;1S of supplementary data). In addition, the phenotype of these T cells was of T<sub>EM</sub> type with the expression of high level of co-stimulatory molecules, similarly to MLTCs from cutaneous melanoma patients (data not shown and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Of note, these T cells, in addition to IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 1S), exerted cytotoxic activity (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) against the autologous tumor cells. Similar data were obtained for cutaneous melanoma-derived MLTCs (data not shown). Ocular melanoma is a rare disease, and therefore, the availability of tumor cell lines and PBMCs in an autologous setting is limited. However, our encouraging results demonstrate a potential future wider exploitation of our protocol that can be of benefit also for these melanoma patients. Since we could not molecularly identify the TAAs recognized by the anti-ocular melanoma MLTC cultures, we will further characterize these immune responses exploiting T cells as probes for the molecular cloning of the target molecule.</p><p>In order to determine whether our MLTC-derived immune responses could be exploited for ACT protocols, we have compared their anti-tumor activity and phenotype with those of TILs. We have isolated TILs from both cutaneous (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) and ocular (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) melanoma patients and found that they specifically exerted autologous tumor recognition (representative data are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The phenotype analysis showed that non-terminally differentiated T<sub>EM</sub> can be isolated from both TILs and MLTCs. However, higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules were found in MLTC lymphocytes, suggesting that efficient anti-tumor activity and persistence in vivo can be associated with MLTCs rather than with TILs.</p><p>By IHC, we also analyzed the presence in vivo of the immune infiltrate in 10 ocular melanoma surgical samples, where we could detect TILs in 9/10 tissues, mostly CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells (6/10 tissues). Only 3 cases showed high numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. We found an heterogeneous expression of TH1 and TH2 type T cells, while the detection of CD25<sup>+</sup> and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was directly associated with high level of CD4. Moreover, in all of the analyzed samples (10/10), high levels of CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages were observed. The presence of these cells in tumor tissues has been described to be correlated with poor prognosis and with suppressive immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, our observations indicate that ocular melanoma potentially represent an immune suppressive environment, in accord with previous published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and similarly to cutaneous melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the ex vivo short-term culture of TILs can rescue their anti-tumor activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Thus far, with our protocol based on the ex vivo enrichment of circulating T cells (MLTCs), we have demonstrated that we can overcome the anergic state of T cells induced by the tumor milieu.</p><p>We obtained a remarkable high frequency of both long-term (perpetual) and short-term (1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months) cell lines in 72 and 57% cutaneous and ocular melanoma, respectively. A low rate of TILs isolation (38%) was observed from our cutaneous melanoma patients as compared to the previous published results (60&#x02013;70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This difference may depend on the limited population size we have analyzed and/or on the small dimensions (0.5&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;cm diameter) of the tumor fragments we have received. In ocular melanoma, there are no documented studies involving the isolation of TILs on a large patient base. Nevertheless, we were able to isolate and successfully culture TILs in 28.5% of our patients. Thus, our data indicate that the application of the MLTC method, which is based on tumor cell availability, can be of interest since it is applicable to a large number of melanoma patients from whom TILs cannot be obtained and, in addition, to ocular melanoma subjects for whom few studies documenting TIL isolation and characterization are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Notably, the REP stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] applied to the in vitro isolated MLTCs indeed led to the successful expansion of these T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The final number of T cells obtained from MLTCs was comparable to that of TILs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>); moreover, we also demonstrated that after the REP, these T lymphocytes retained their initial specific anti-tumor activity (Figure&#x000a0;3S of supplementary data available online). Thus, we identified a new protocol that allows the isolation of large number (2&#x02013;10 billions) of T lymphocytes to be infused in melanoma patients.</p><p>Durable clinical responses have been recently documented in stage IV melanoma patients infused with polyclonal anti-tumor PBMCs, pre-stimulated in vitro with the autologous tumor cells, and given in combination with low-dose IFN-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This indicates that by the exploitation of the immunogenicity of tumor cells, it is possible to efficiently isolate and direct systemic anti-tumor immune responses against the residual tumor cells.</p><p>A limitation of our approach is the availability of autologous tumor cells, although as we have shown above (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 1S of supplementary results) that short-term cultured melanoma cells can be used. Alternatively, to overcome the lack of autologous tumor cell lines, HLA-matched/-semimatched allogeneic melanoma lines could be used as stimulators of PBMCs. Indeed, tumor reactive TILs have been selected ex vivo by the usage of allogeneic tumor cells as stimulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, we have carried out a detailed characterization of immune responses of T cells from the peripheral blood vs tumor tissues of both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients that allowed us identifying a novel MLTC-based protocol to isolate and successfully expand ex vivo polyclonal anti-tumor circulating T cells. In addition, our protocol can overcome the possible anergic state of TILs due to the immunesuppressive tumor environment. We envision that our method may be suitable for ACT protocols, when TILs are not available, for both cutaneous and ocular melanoma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="262_2011_1179_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 12.2 mb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted with Mrs Gloria Sovena (Unit of Immuno-biotherapy of Melanoma and Solid Tumors, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy) for the technical assistance in the establishment in vitro of melanoma lines and the isolation and expansion of T lymphocytes and with Mrs Ylenia Papa (Unit of Pathology, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy) for assistance in tissue preparation and staining for IHC analysis.
