The median age at diagnosis of ET is approximately 65&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years with its incidence increasing with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Previous retrospective studies suggest that patients with ET aged &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years have an increased risk of thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, previous randomized controlled trials suggest that thrombosis risk is reduced when patients are treated with cytoreductive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, according to international guidelines, high-risk patients with ET (patients &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years of age; history of thrombohaemorrhagic events; initial platelet count &#x0003e;1500&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L) should be considered for cytoreductive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Hydroxycarbamide (HC) is currently recommended for first-line therapy in high-risk patients with ET of all ages, although it should be used with caution in patients aged &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Anagrelide is approved for second-line treatment of ET in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both HC and anagrelide have been used in patients with a wide range of ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since the overall population with ET are of advanced age, we believe it would be of value to more closely assess the very elderly patients (aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years), for whom different treatment decisions may be appropriate. Elderly patients are known to have greater thrombotic risk than younger patients in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and this risk is already increased in patients with ET. To date, there has been limited information reported regarding treatment practice in very elderly patients with ET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>EXELS (Evaluation of Xagrid Efficacy and Long-term Safety) is a phase IV study, designed to monitor the safety of anagrelide and other cytoreductive therapies in patients with ET in routine clinical practice. Additional objectives include improving the understanding of the risks involved in long-term use of cytoreductive agents in ET. The aim of this analysis is to characterize the baseline features and management of patients with ET aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years, who were enrolled in the EXELS study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Design and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This is an ongoing phase IV non-interventional post-approval commitment study observing high-risk patients with ET who are treated with cytoreductive therapy. The EXELS study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00567502; Protocol: SPD422-401) is being conducted in 13 European countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The first patient entered the study in May 2005 following local ethics committee approval at all participating centres. Predefined clinical events and biological data (including full blood counts) were collected from each patient at the time of registration and every 6&#x000a0;months thereafter for 5&#x000a0;years, using an electronic data capture system. The last patient was registered in April 2009 and the study will be completed in June 2014. This analysis was performed on a data-cut taken in March 2011. The EXELS study is non-interventional and no comparisons are made between groups due to the non-interventional nature of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with a diagnosis of ET according to the World Health Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and/or Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] with one or more high-risk features (patients &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years of age; history of thrombohaemorrhagic events; initial platelet count &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L), and receiving cytoreductive therapy, were eligible for study inclusion. Exclusion criteria were limited to the contraindications listed in the product information of the cytoreductive therapy. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before entering the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatment</title><p>As this was a non-interventional study, the choice of cytoreductive therapy was determined prior to study registration and patients were managed according to local practice at the discretion of the investigators. Data related to predefined events (PDEs), suspected serious adverse reactions (SSARs), platelet count and any changes to medication were recorded at each 6-month update. Patients with multiple events of the same PDE category were only counted once for each treatment received. Thromboembolic events were defined in this analysis as the following PDEs: myocardial infarction (MI) and angina, stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), intermittent claudication/digital ischaemia, and venous thromboembolic events. All safety evaluations and procedures were performed in accordance with routine clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions were calculated and assessed for statistical significance using Chi-squared tests between reasons for treatment switch. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether the inclusion of treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients had affected the differences in platelet counts over time. The statistical software used was SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 3,598 patients were enrolled in the EXELS study, including 395 (11&#x000a0;%) very elderly (aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years) patients.

However, almost one-third of patients switched for &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons, which were largely due to lack of control of platelet counts and reductions in counts of white blood cells or Hb (data not shown). The reasons for first switch were similar between HC and anagrelide treatment in the overall study population. However, in very elderly patients, 0/16 reported treatment with anagrelide was non-efficacious compared with 8/57 (14&#x000a0;%) patients receiving HC, and 7/16 (43.8&#x000a0;%) anagrelide patients switched due to intolerance versus 18/57 (31.6&#x000a0;%) patients receiving HC.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Treatment switching in patients aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years and the total EXELS population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2">Variable</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Age category<sup>a</sup></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Age &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years</th><th align="left">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"><italic>Frequency of first switch</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Switch from any monotherapy</td><td align="left">91/395 (23.0) [18.9&#x02013;27.2]</td><td align="left">902/3,596 (25.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Switch from HC monotherapy</td><td align="left">57/327 (17.4) [13.3&#x02013;21.5]</td><td align="left">455/2,340 (19.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Switch from anagrelide monotherapy</td><td align="left">16/34 (47.1) [30.3&#x02013;63.8]</td><td align="left">237/792 (30.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"><italic>Reasons for first switch from HC</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intolerance/side effects</td><td align="left">18/57 (31.6) [19.5&#x02013;43.6]</td><td align="left">127/455 (27.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-efficacious</td><td align="left">8/57 (14.0) [5.0&#x02013;23.1]</td><td align="left">55/455 (12.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Subject preference</td><td align="left">1/57 (1.8) [0&#x02013;5.2]</td><td align="left">9/455 (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Other</td><td align="left">17/57 (29.8) [17.9&#x02013;41.7]</td><td align="left">133/455 (29.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Missing</td><td align="left">10/57 (17.5) [7.7&#x02013;27.4]</td><td align="left">138/455 (30.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Unknown</td><td align="left">5/57 (8.8) [1.4&#x02013;16.1]</td><td align="left">10/455 (2.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3"><italic>Reasons for first switch from anagrelide</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intolerance/side effects</td><td align="left">7/16 (43.8) [19.4&#x02013;68.1]</td><td align="left">69/237 (29.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Non-efficacious</td><td align="left">0/16 (0.0) [NA]</td><td align="left">31/237 (13.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Subject preference</td><td align="left">1/16 (6.3) [0&#x02013;18.1]</td><td align="left">13/237 (5.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Other (including economic)</td><td align="left">6/16 (37.5) [13.8&#x02013;61.2]</td><td align="left">47/237 (19.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Missing</td><td align="left">2/16 (12.5) [0&#x02013;28.7]</td><td align="left">76/237 (32.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Unknown</td><td align="left">0/16 (0.0) [NA]</td><td align="left">9/237 (3.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>CI</italic> confidence interval, <italic>HC</italic> hydroxycarbamide, <italic>NA</italic> not applicable</p><p><sup>a</sup>Values are expressed as n (%) [95&#x000a0;% CI]</p><p><sup>b</sup>Patients with missing data: <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates for first treatment switch in patients aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40261_2012_42_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Predefined Clinical Events</title><p>The total numbers of predefined clinical events (PDEs), and details of notable PDEs, are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.

Sparse data are available on the treatment of very elderly patients with ET. Notably, Palandri et al. reported data on 118 patients with ET aged &#x0003e;75&#x000a0;years, who they classified as very elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They retrospectively analysed 326 consecutive patients with ET diagnosed at &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years, although no patients aged &#x0003e;75&#x000a0;years received anagrelide and, perhaps because of this, only 5.3&#x000a0;% discontinued HC because of adverse effects. The information collected from EXELS provides valuable insight into the treatment of these very elderly patients in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Treatment</title><p>The vast majority of very elderly patients were receiving HC and although anagrelide was the next most frequently used agent, the proportion of patients receiving it was low (8.6&#x000a0;%). These results suggest that the expert recommendations for ET therapy are applied by physicians across Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of patients who were receiving their first cytoreductive treatment, at the time of entering the EXELS study, increased with patient age. The high proportion of very elderly patients receiving first-line HC is probably due to the fact that there is broad agreement among physicians that HC is the treatment of choice for very elderly patients and because HC is well tolerated in general. Concerns regarding the potential leukaemogenicity of HC are less relevant for older patients than younger ones, since their life expectancy is reduced. Furthermore, physicians may be reluctant to use anagrelide in older patients due to the recognized inotropic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], making HC the agent of choice and options for switch limited. However, our results have shown that anagrelide can be effective and well tolerated, and provides a good alternative treatment option to busulphan, in very elderly patients for whom HC is unsuitable. Indeed, Italian guidelines recommend the continuation of anagrelide in patients aged &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years for as long as it continues to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Blood Cell Counts</title><p>The initial reduction in platelet counts that was observed in all age groups was shown to be significantly affected by the treatment-na&#x000ef;ve population. When these patients were removed from the analysis, the platelet counts remained fairly consistent.</p><p>The data suggest that the &#x02018;target platelet count&#x02019;, the point at which platelet counts are allowed to bottom-out, is ~450&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L for the very elderly patients in clinical practice. The criteria for a complete haematological response with ET therapy published by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) include a target platelet count below 400&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is a positive finding that these very elderly patients achieved levels that were close to target. Physicians may be particularly stringent about achieving low platelet counts in very elderly patients as this population has a higher incidence of previous vascular events (also shown in this study), which is a major risk factor for recurrent thrombosis. The ELN guidelines also include the following criteria in the definition of complete haematological response: normal spleen size on imaging, white blood cell count below 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L, and absence of disease-related symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, since EXELS predates the publication of these guidelines, these criteria were not considered in the study design and these data were not collected. Response rates were judged only on platelet levels.</p><p>Although anaemia has been reported with both of the major therapeutic agents used in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms, the Hb values did not change over time in these patients. Anaemia is defined as a Hb value of &#x0003c;12&#x000a0;g/dL in adult females and &#x0003c;13&#x000a0;g/dL in adult males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The mean baseline Hb levels in the very elderly population were 12.0&#x000a0;g/dL, with the median values ranging from 11.5 to 12.3&#x000a0;g/dL over time. Since more than two-thirds of these patients were female, the Hb levels were on the low side of the normal range, which may be due to the large proportion of patients receiving treatment with HC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Treatment Switching</title><p>The proportion of very elderly patients switching from anagrelide was 47.1 vs. 17.4&#x000a0;% from HC. The reason for first switch from HC or anagrelide was more often because of intolerance than loss of efficacy. Similar proportions of patients switched from HC because of lack of efficacy in our study and that of Palandri et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Elderly patients have more frequent cardiac abnormalities than younger patients, which may make them more prone to switch treatment if they experience tachycardia or palpitations while receiving anagrelide. A further explanation for high levels of switching from anagrelide in older patients may be that various national guidelines suggest that HC, pipobroman or busulphan are preferable for the treatment of the oldest patients with ET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the small number of very elderly patients treated with anagrelide in EXELS (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;34) precludes the formation of any strong conclusions concerning treatment switching. Low rates of switching therapy because of inefficacy (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), along with almost normal target platelet count observed in patients &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years, show that cytoreductive therapy in very elderly patients is effective. Indeed, tolerance is the main issue in managing patients of all ages with ET in clinical practice and is a particular concern in very elderly patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Predefined Clinical Events</title><p>Overall, 108 patients aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years experienced a total of 167 PDEs, including vascular complications (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;90), haematological transformation (to acute leukaemia or myelofibrosis; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) and non-PDE deaths (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;44). However, no new safety concerns were observed in these patients. Thromboembolic events happen in patients with ET, irrespective of the use of cytoreductive therapy, and elderly patients are also recognized to have a slightly increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The very elderly patients in the study by Palandri et al. also experienced a greater thrombotic risk than those aged &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;years. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] Although data on the incidence of angina in a non-MPN population are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], uncertainties concerning diagnostic definitions and data collection principles make comparisons with the EXELS population unreliable.</p><p>The incidence of stroke and TIA in the very elderly patients in the EXELS study was 1.3 and 1.0&#x000a0;%, respectively. In comparison, across Europe between 2001 and 2009, stroke and TIA accounted for 0.45&#x000a0;% of annual hospital admissions in adults aged &#x02265;80&#x000a0;years (0.29 and 0.15&#x000a0;% each, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, these events were substantially more frequent in the very elderly population in EXELS than the European elderly population. Diseases of the circulatory system (not including angina, MI, ischaemic or pulmonary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, cerebrovascular diseases, atherosclerosis or varicose veins), which included pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, occurred in less than 0.3&#x000a0;% of European adults aged &#x02265;80&#x000a0;years annually between 2001 and 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In comparison, venous thromboembolisms occurred in 1.2&#x000a0;% of all patients in EXELS and 1.8&#x000a0;% of those aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years. Therefore, the risk of thromboembolisms was substantially raised in patients in EXELS and particularly so in those aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years versus the overall European population.</p><p>Of note, similar proportions of patients aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years and patients in the overall EXELS population experienced thromboembolic events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, here we describe an analysis of very elderly patients from the largest ever observational study of patients with ET, providing new data on ET management of these patients in clinical practice. The haematological response and normalization of platelet counts achieved with cautious management of these patients is particularly promising. It is also of interest to note that intolerance to cytoreductive therapy is the main reason for treatment switch, not only in these very elderly patients but in patients of all ages.</p><p>To summarize, well-tolerated and effective cytoreductive therapy has been achieved in patients aged &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;years by following individual treatment modalities that appear in agreement with the recent ELN guidelines.
