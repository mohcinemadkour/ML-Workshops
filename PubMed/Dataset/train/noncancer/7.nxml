</title><p>Nondisabling cerebrovascular events represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease with a high risk of recurrent stroke. A recent trial demonstrated that dual-antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin), compared with aspirin monotherapy, reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic events. Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, has been proven to be as safe and effective as traditional anticoagulants while carrying significantly less risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke might benefit from apixaban treatment; therefore, an adequately powered randomized study is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>The ADANCE [Apixaban Versus Dual-antiplatelet Therapy (Clopidogrel and Aspirin) in Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events] study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with a target enrollment of 5,500 patients. A 21-day regimen of apixaban or of clopidogrel with aspirin followed by clopidogrel on days 22 through 90 will be administered to randomized participants with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with any new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage), including fatal stroke, at day 21. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, and at days 7, 22, and 90.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The novel oral anticoagulant apixaban has been widely used with fewer adverse effects than traditional anticoagulants. We designed the ADANCE trial to observe the effects of apixaban on recurrent stroke after TIA or minor stroke. The results should better guide the selection of anticoagulant or dual-antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke, the leading cause of acquired disability, affects 15&#x000a0;million people worldwide every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) and acute minor ischemic stroke, defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &#x02264;3, represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease. About 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of patients with ischemic stroke have had a prior TIA or minor stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A previous study suggests that the 90-day risk of a subsequent stroke is 10.5&#x000a0;% after TIA and that almost half of these strokes could occur within the first 2&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. After a minor stroke, the risk of recurrence is as high as 18.5&#x000a0;% at day&#x000a0;90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Aspirin, the gold standard of medical care for antiplatelet therapy, has been used most extensively for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which has a narrow therapeutic window (up to 4.5&#x000a0;h after symptom onset) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and traditional anticoagulants with a higher risk of bleeding events, aspirin has a modest effect on acute ischemic stroke. Compared to placebo, aspirin administration shows a slight increase in the risk of cerebral hemorrhage. The recently published CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients With Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported superior results with dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), i.e., superiority of clopidogrel&#x02013;aspirin over aspirin monotherapy. DAPT was not associated with increased hemorrhage events. The results shed light on the benefits of exploiting more effective medical therapy for patients suffering non-disabling cerebrovascular diseases.</p><p>Traditional anticoagulants have been used to lower the risk of early recurrent stroke; however, the benefit is negated by an increasing rate of bleeding complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, the novel oral anticoagulants have received extensive attention because of the following advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]: (1) they directly target the coagulation cascade with rapid onset/offset of action; (2) fewer adverse effects (especially lower rates of major hemorrhage); (3) lower risk for drug&#x02013;drug interactions; and (4) a more predictable response. Apixaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, as one of these novel oral anticoagulants, has been approved for preventing venous thromboembolism after elective hip or knee replacement in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and for reducing the risk of stroke and dangerous blood clots (systemic embolism) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) by the US Food and Drug Administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that apixaban could reduce the risks of systemic embolism, bleeding events, and all-cause mortality, with better tolerability in patients with AF, compared with warfarin treatment. The AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] confirmed that apixaban was associated with more effective reduction of stroke and a similar risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin in patients with AF. Hence, we speculated that apixaban might show better effect on patients with TIA or acute ischemic stroke.</p><p>To date, the effect of apixaban versus DAPT (clopidogrel and aspirin) on acute non-disabling cerebrovascular disease is still unconfirmed. In the ADANCE study, we will enroll patients with TIA and minor ischemic stroke who are showing particularly high risk for recurrent ischemia, low risk for hemorrhage, and relatively stable systematic conditions after cerebrovascular event onset. The study was designed to estimate whether apixaban administration is superior to DAPT, in order to decrease recurrent stroke in Chinese patients after TIA and acute minor stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Objective</title><p>An initial 3&#x000a0;weeks of apixaban versus DAPT therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) followed by clopidogrel alone in high-risk patients with acute non-disabling cerebrovascular event (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01924325) is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial enrolling 5,500 Chinese patients with acute TIA or minor stroke. The primary objective of the trial is to determine whether apixaban is safe and could reduce the risk of any stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) when initiated within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset in high-risk patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke as compared with DAPT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Participants</title><p>In total, 5,500 patients will be recruited through 100 emergency departments in general hospitals in China. Two subtypes of patients will be enrolled: (i) acute non-disabling ischemic stroke; and (ii) acute TIA. Ischemic stroke is defined as an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit that is attributable to acute occlusion of an intracranial vessel. The standard definition of TIA requires that all neurologic signs and symptoms resolve within 24&#x000a0;h, regardless of whether there is imaging evidence of new permanent brain injury; stroke has occurred if the neurologic signs and symptoms last for &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;h, with image evidence of a new brain infarction. Informed consent will be supported by a patient (or next of kin) information leaflet in Chinese. A consultation meeting will be developed by a study physician to ensure patients and their families understand the study procedure and consent to participation in the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The study has been approved by the Medical Ethical Reviewing Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University Medical Center, Xi&#x02019;an, China.

According to previous clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the 90-day risk of stroke recurrence in the placebo (aspirin) group is about 14&#x000a0;% among high-risk TIA (ABCD<sup>2</sup> score &#x02265;4) or minor stroke patients treated with aspirin within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset. The CHANCE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] further indicated that, as compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel and aspirin treatment reduced the risk of recurrent stroke by 32&#x000a0;% and was not associated with increased hemorrhage events. The results from our preliminary study were used to calculate the sample size (unpublished data). The ratios of the 90-day stroke recurrence in the DAPT group and apixaban group were 10.47 and 7.96&#x000a0;%, respectively. Therefore, we presume that the 90-day risk of stroke recurrence is 10.5&#x000a0;% among high-risk TIA or minor stroke patients with clopidogrel&#x02013;aspirin therapy within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset. A relative risk reduction of 24&#x000a0;% (relative risk with addition of apixaban is 0.76) is the smallest difference we will attempt to detect.

Recently, a few effective therapies have been established according to clinical trials. Aspirin is the mainstay antiplatelet therapy that has been used in patients with an acute cerebrovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for a long time. Clopidogrel, a platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist, has been shown to be as effective for secondary stroke prevention as aspirin, with a similar rate of ischemic stroke, MI, or vascular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Clopidogrel could not produce maximal inhibition of platelet aggregation in a conventional dose (75&#x000a0;mg/day) for 5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This delay presents a problem for an early treatment effect in the management of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Recently, DAPT indicated a reduced risk of recurrent stroke and an acceptable risk of hemorrhage events for high-risk patients with non-disabling cerebrovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, we can&#x02019;t deny the possibility that there may have been some other medical regimen that could improve outcomes in those patients.</p><p>Patients administered with traditional anticoagulants immediately after acute ischemic stroke onset have been reported to have a lower risk of recurrent stroke and an increased rate of bleeding complications, as compared with untreated patients or patients who received an antiplatelet agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, in recent times, novel oral anticoagulants, including direct factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors, have shown advantage in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and preventing or treating venous thromboembolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] with fewer hemorrhagic adverse effects and a preferable response compared with traditional anticoagulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently, apixaban (a direct factor Xa inhibitor) has received broad attention for its reliable anticoagulant effect and lower rates of major hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Compared with warfarin, apixaban shows better tolerability and a lower rate of systemic embolism, bleeding events, and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Compared with aspirin, apixaban has been found to have a similar risk of major bleeding and reduced risk of stroke onset in patients with AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the effects of apixaban on the early recurrent stroke risk after TIA and acute minor stroke are still uncertain. The ADANCE trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter controlled clinical trial in China. We will assess the effect of a 3-month regimen of apixaban treatment for the first 21&#x000a0;days followed by clopidogrel monotherapy versus a 3-month regimen of DAPT for the first 21&#x000a0;days followed by clopidogrel alone, on reducing the 3-month risk of any stroke when initiated within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset in high-risk patients with TIA or minor stroke.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>F.
