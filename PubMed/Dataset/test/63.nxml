Urinary urgency is particularly bothersome for persons with OAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. OAB is highly prevalent, with a frequency that increases with age. An estimation model based on sex- and age-stratified prevalence data and International Continence Society definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] suggested that the overall prevalence of OAB was 10.7&#x000a0;% in 2008 and predicted an increase of 20.1&#x000a0;%, from 455 to 546 million, by the year 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This followed earlier data from a population-based survey based on 16,776 interviews in six European countries that showed an overall prevalence of OAB symptoms of 16.6&#x000a0;% in persons aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;40&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Patients with OAB have decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including health-related work impairment, depression and sexual/relationship difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with OAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and patients report significant social, psychological, occupational, domestic and physical stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The prevalence of OAB and its effects on HRQoL means that effective therapy is needed.</p><p>Treatment options for OAB include conservative management (lifestyle advice, bladder training, etc.), followed by drug therapy and surgery where required; the primary pharmacological option has traditionally been muscarinic receptor antagonist therapy (antimuscarinic drugs; e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine and solifenacin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These inhibit abnormal detrusor contractions in the bladder, but also inhibit muscarinic receptors elsewhere in the body, such as the salivary glands, tear ducts, brain and heart, to varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This non-specificity results in adverse events, the most common and troublesome of which are dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Adverse events, together with unmet efficacy expectations, are the primary reasons for discontinuation of antimuscarinic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, alternative approaches to OAB therapy have been developed and approved, the most important of which is &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor (&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-AR) stimulation to promote storage of urine in the bladder via detrusor relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-AR agonist mirabegron (Betmiga&#x02122;; Astellas) has been shown in phase III trials to be effective and well tolerated in the management of OAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These trials showed that mirabegron therapy significantly improves outcomes such as the number of incontinence episodes and micturitions per 24&#x000a0;h compared to placebo at 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and is well tolerated with sustained efficacy for up to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In trials in which patients were randomised to mirabegron, tolterodine or placebo, the incidence of dry mouth with tolterodine was at least threefold that with mirabegron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In these trials, tolterodine produced mean decreases in the number of incontinence episodes and micturitions per 24&#x000a0;h that were not significantly greater than those with placebo at 12&#x000a0;weeks, but were similar to those with mirabegron at 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Economic analyses comparing different treatments are now an important factor in making decisions regarding purchasing, pricing, reimbursement and formulary acceptance. To date, however, no economic analyses of mirabegron in the treatment of OAB have been published. Therefore, a Markov model was developed to analyse the cost effectiveness of mirabegron 50&#x000a0;mg/day relative to currently available antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of OAB. We describe the model in detail and report an analysis of the cost effectiveness of mirabegron 50&#x000a0;mg compared with tolterodine extended release (ER) 4&#x000a0;mg in adult patients with OAB from a UK National Health Service (NHS) payer perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model Overview</title><p>A Markov model was developed to simulate the therapeutic management, course of disease, and effect of complications in hypothetical cohorts of OAB patients over a 5-year period (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;1). Several existing models based on a structure developed by Kobelt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were already available, but were limited to a time horizon of 1&#x000a0;year and did not model treatment pathways after drop-out. Thus, differences in costs and outcomes related to treatments used after withdrawal could not be accurately estimated. We captured the influence of treatment discontinuation and switch on costs and OAB symptoms. This is particularly important because persistence with antimuscarinic agents affects HRQoL, health status and healthcare resource utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. HRQoL was assumed to be dependent on both variations in symptoms over time and the side effects of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The SCORPIO Trial</title><p>SCORPIO was a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled phase III trial carried out in 27 countries in Europe and Australasia to compare the efficacy and safety of mirabegron 50 and 100&#x000a0;mg daily with those of placebo in patients with OAB treated over 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The co-primary endpoints were the change from baseline to final visit in the mean number of incontinence episodes and micturitions per 24&#x000a0;h. Assessment of safety and tolerability was a secondary endpoint. A secondary comparison of the efficacy and safety of treatment with tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg daily and placebo was also performed.</p><p>In total, 1,987 patients were randomised. Mirabegron produced statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) improvements (adjusted mean change from baseline [95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals]) compared with placebo in terms of number of incontinence episodes per 24&#x000a0;h (50&#x000a0;mg: &#x02212;1.57 [&#x02212;1.79 to &#x02212;1.35]; placebo &#x02013;1.17 [&#x02212;1.39 to &#x02013;0.95]) and number of micturitions per 24&#x000a0;h (50&#x000a0;mg: &#x02212;1.93 [&#x02212;2.15 to &#x02212;1.72]; placebo &#x02212;1.34 [&#x02212;1.55 to &#x02212;1.12]). Statistically significant improvements were also noted for other key efficacy endpoints and HRQoL outcomes. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatment groups, but the incidence of dry mouth with mirabegron 50&#x000a0;mg was similar to placebo (2.8 and 2.6&#x000a0;%, respectively), whereas it was more than threefold higher in patients receiving tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg (10.1&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Model Description</title><p>The model was programmed to run in Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). The treatment pathway, based on the model described above, for the analysis is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Transitions are shown in more detail in Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;1. The model simulated changes in symptoms (frequency of micturitions and incontinence episodes, for which the model was run in parallel) at monthly intervals (i.e. 60 cycles over 5&#x000a0;years). Every month, patients could remain on treatment (mirabegron or tolterodine), switch to a treatment with efficacy and price similar to solifenacin or discontinue (i.e. go to &#x02018;no treatment&#x02019;). A small proportion received botulinum toxin (BTX) after this next line of therapy (this transition was not allowed directly after mirabegron or tolterodine). The probabilities of switch and discontinuation were dependent on adverse events. Patients with adverse events could stay on treatment, but incurred a disutility. Patients who discontinued treatment could naturally improve and thereby transition to a lower severity category after 1&#x000a0;month, or could worsen or stay the same. These patients could also restart their previous treatment, could move to a new treatment, or remain off treatment. In the event of success on BTX, patients were assumed to move to the lowest level of severity and remain there until the end of the simulation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Markov treatment pathway. <italic>BTX</italic> botulinum toxin, <italic>ER</italic> extended release, <italic>OAB</italic> overactive bladder syndrome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40261_2014_240_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The model accounted for the differences in probability of improving or worsening between the short- and long-term. Thus, the probability of improvement was greatest in the first month after treatment initiation, after which it decreased progressively, and was then assumed constant after 3&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Several populations were considered. Any patient presenting with OAB formed the base case population. Other populations considered were patients dissatisfied with previous treatment, patients dissatisfied with previous treatment due to lack of efficacy, patients dissatisfied with previous treatment due to intolerance, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients, elderly patients, female patients, male patients and incontinent patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Model Input Parameters</title><p>All model input parameters are presented in detail in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Symptom Severity</title><p>Symptoms (micturition frequency and incontinence) had five levels of severity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Medication costs were higher with mirabegron than with tolterodine (&#x000a3;451.43 vs. &#x000a3;343.70), mainly due to the differences in time to discontinuation (Table&#x000a0;4).

The one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ICER remained below the WTP threshold of &#x000a3;20,000 whenever a parameter was modified. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which tested uncertainty around the model parameters through Monte Carlo simulations using appropriate distributions, demonstrated a high probability (89.4&#x000a0;%) that mirabegron 50 mg/day would be cost effective compared with tolterodine ER 4 mg/day at the generally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of &#x000a3;20,000/QALY gained. Overall, the subgroup analyses also supported the primary result.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no other economic analyses of mirabegron in the treatment of OAB with which to compare our findings are available in the literature. However, previously published cost-effectiveness models comparing tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg with other antimuscarinic agents suggest that our results are plausible. Speakman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] developed a 1-year Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of solifenacin 5&#x000a0;mg and 10&#x000a0;mg compared with tolterodine (immediate release 2&#x000a0;mg twice daily or ER 4&#x000a0;mg daily) in OAB from the UK NHS perspective, while a 1-year model developed by Cardozo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] assessed the cost effectiveness of solifenacin against other antimuscarinic agents commonly used in UK clinical practice, including tolterodine. The predicted total annual costs per patient for tolterodine were &#x000a3;526 and &#x000a3;480, in the Speakman and Cardoza studies respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], compared with an annual cost of &#x000a3;620 in our model when run over a 1-year time horizon. The difference in costs was mainly due to our assumption that all patients initiating a new treatment would consult a specialist. The respective numbers of QALYs for 1&#x000a0;year with tolterodine were 0.705 and 0.710 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], compared with 0.814 in our model, with the difference being due to our use of a new set of utilities based on EQ-5D data collected in clinical trials of mirabegron. However, the difference between the maximum and minimum utilities in this new model is similar to the range in the earlier model of Speakman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (0.145 vs. 0.144). Furthermore, the QALY gain based on our model (0.009) is consistent with these and other previous studies that used EQ-5D (0.004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], 0.014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and 0.004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). This suggests that the magnitude of the QALY gain is meaningful in OAB, although it should be noted that as a generic tool EQ-5D is relatively insensitive to changes in OAB symptoms. An analysis mapping EQ-5D scores to those obtained with the OAB-specific OAB-5D instrument has shown that scores are higher with OAB-5D, suggesting that the magnitude of any differences would also be higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>In other analyses carried out from a UK health system perspective, Hakkaart et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found incremental costs per QALY gained over placebo to be &#x000a3;17,602 and &#x000a3;24,464 with solifenacin 5&#x000a0;mg and 10&#x000a0;mg daily, respectively, in a Markov model run over a 12-month time horizon in patients with OAB, and Getsios et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed that a sustained-release formulation of oxybutynin 10&#x000a0;mg dominated immediate-release tolterodine 4&#x000a0;mg. Another analysis has suggested that immediate- and sustained-release oxybutynin and tolterodine ER are all cost-effective options for managing urge incontinence from a UK NHS perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These findings suggest strongly that economic comparisons of mirabegron with these and other antimuscarinic agents will be of considerable interest to clinicians and healthcare policy makers. In addition to the analysis reported here, a model based on a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) of mirabegron and antimuscarinic therapy for OAB has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This demonstrated that the efficacy of mirabegron 50 mg in OAB patients is similar to that of most approved antimuscarinic drugs in the general OAB population and that it has the most favourable tolerability profile, with a significantly lower incidence of dry mouth than any antimuscarinic agent and the same incidence of constipation as placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>A key strength of our model is that it was designed to capture the effects on HRQoL of variations in symptom severity over time, as well as the impact of treatment discontinuation and switching on costs and health outcomes. In contrast, previous Markov models for this type of analysis have been based on the extensively applied model developed by Kobelt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which consists of five health states representing different levels of disease severity with a single absorbing state for drop-outs, who were considered to remain off treatment. We found that the main symptoms of OAB (micturitions and incontinence) had a significant influence on utility independently of each other, with moderate correlations between changes in these symptoms. The progression of these symptoms over time was therefore modelled separately. In addition, we attached increased importance to the modelling of patient pathways after treatment discontinuation, because of the high rates of discontinuation and treatment switching observed in patients with OAB. Finally, the use of a 5-year time horizon, at which point&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;% of patients remained on treatment in the model, and performing sensitivity analyses based on other time-points, at which the conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron held, ensured that the model reflected the costs and outcomes of managing a chronic condition. Therefore, we believe that our model more accurately represents the clinical management of OAB.</p><p>Another strength is that we have analysed the cost effectiveness of therapy in various relevant patient subgroups. These analyses showed that mirabegron was consistently cost effective in most of these subgroups.</p><p>In contrast, possible limitations include the assumption that discontinuation rates due to reasons other than adverse events were similar for mirabegron and tolterodine, because no real-life data on persistence with mirabegron are available. We believe that this is a conservative assumption because the MTC demonstrated that the probability of mirabegron being more effective than tolterodine in terms of micturition and incontinence is 87.4 and 88.3&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, no data on the probability of BTX being used to treat OAB following drug therapy and no data on the numbers of visits to specialists were available. Again, we took a conservative approach and assumed that the proportions of patients receiving BTX were small; sensitivity analysis showed that the ICER would increase modestly if no patients received BTX and that mirabegron remained cost effective. The impact of varying the numbers of visits to specialists was also assessed in a sensitivity analysis, which showed that this affected the absolute results, but not sufficiently to change the conclusion that mirabegron is cost effective. Furthermore, number of specialist visits was not one of the main parameters to which the model was sensitive.</p><p>The model used in our analysis included direct healthcare costs only, in line with the requirements of UK guidelines for pharmacoeconomic assessments. The failure to include indirect costs in the model represents another potential limitation, but a sensitivity analysis including indirect costs showed that ICERs were lower in all comparisons, with mirabegron being dominant in all populations except the previously treated and men subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, from a UK NHS perspective, mirabegron 50&#x000a0;mg/day appears to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with tolterodine ER 4&#x000a0;mg/day for the general population of adults with OAB and for subgroups including those previously treated and those who are treatment naive, patients dissatisfied due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, patients who are incontinent, the elderly, and women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40261_2014_240_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PDF 750 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Astellas Pharma Global Development.
