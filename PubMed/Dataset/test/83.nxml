Although second-generation antipsychotics were associated with pancreatitis, quetiapine-associated pancreatitis is extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We present a previously healthy 78-years-old Caucasian male who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) following a traffic road accident. The patient was intubated due to a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. Upon admission, brain computed tomography (CT) scan depicted a small, right-sided subdural hygroma, but otherwise was unrevealing. Abdominal and thoracic CT scans as well as routine biochemistry and blood tests were normal. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated five days after his admission to the ICU as his neurological status upon awakening was normalized. At that time, the patient developed delirium, and he was started on quetiapine 25&#x02009;mg twice daily, with the dosage being progressively titrated to 50&#x02009;mg every 12 hours, by the psychiatry consultant. Three days after the initiation of antipsychotic therapy the patient became febrile (38&#x000b0;C), confused, and was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a mildly distended abdomen, while routine blood tests were normal. Soon after the patient became hemodynamically unstable, and he was reintubated. No evidence of infection could be documented. By-the-bed sonography depicted hypoechoic pancreas without any other pathology. Two days following reintubation, the patient developed leukocytosis (WBC = 16000/lt and 80% neutrophils) and his serum levels of amylase (2210&#x02009;IU/lt) and lipase (1282&#x02009;IU/lt) were increased, while his serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and liver enzymes were normal. No evidence of hypertriglyceridemia, diabetic ketoacidosis or other metabolic abnormality could be documented. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. Abdominal CT scans depicted severe acute pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid, without any other pathology. Quetiapine was discontinued, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive treatment for pancreatitis. Despite all efforts, he developed acute renal failure with ensuing acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he finally expired. Autopsy findings confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatitis.</p><p>Pancreatitis could be attributed to various causes such as gallstones, alcohol use, medication toxicity, hypercalcemia and hypertriglyceridemia, trauma from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, abdominal trauma, various infections, autoimmune, ischemia, and hereditary causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our patient received quetiapine, which is commonly used along with haloperidol, for the treatment of delirium in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Quetiapine has been associated with the development of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It remains obscure whether the above metabolic effects of quetiapine are dose dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. According to published guidelines, patients receiving second-generation antipsychotic drugs should receive baseline screening and ongoing monitoring of plasma glucose and lipid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this case, the use of quetiapine could not be linked to serious metabolic side effects. In the absence of other potential risk factors, we presumed that the development of pancreatitis could be attributed to quetiapine. Further studies are clearly required to investigate this association. Intensivists should be alerted when treating critical care patients with second-generation antipsychotics, as metabolic risks and/or pancreatitis might present and potentially lead to hazardous results.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and safety of quetiapine in critically ill patients with delirium: a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study</article-title><source><italic>Critical Care Medicine</italic></source><year>2010</year><volume>38</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>419</fpage><lpage>427</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19915454</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Koller</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cross</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Doraiswamy</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Malozowski</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pancreatitis associated with atypical antipsychotics: from the Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s MedWatch surveillance system and published reports</article-title><source><italic>Pharmacotherapy</italic></source><year>2003</year><volume>23</volume><issue>9 I</issue><fpage>1123</fpage><lpage>1130</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14524644</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rashid</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Starer</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Javaid</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis with quetiapine use</article-title><source><italic>Psychiatry</italic></source><year>2009</year><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>34</fpage><lpage>37</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19724733</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ala-Kokko</surname><given-names>TI</given-names></name><name><surname>Tieranta</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Laurila</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Syrj&#x000e4;l&#x000e4;</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Determinants of ICU mortality in necrotizing pancreatitis: the influence of Staphylococcus epidermidis</article-title><source><italic>Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica</italic></source><year>2001</year><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>853</fpage><lpage>857</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11472287</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>American Diabetes Association</collab><article-title>Consensus Development Conference on Antipsychotic Drugs and Obesity and Diabetes</article-title><source><italic>Diabetes Care</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>27</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>596</fpage><lpage>601</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14747245</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
