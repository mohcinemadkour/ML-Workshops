ESCs comprise somatic stem cells, which are restricted to a set of lineages and normally evolves from their tissues of origin. Adult stem cells are multipotent, not pluripotent, and they can differentiate into limited cell types<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>. Since Evans <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> reported the first isolation of ESCs in 1981, stem cell research has been a novel hotspot and provides new prospects for regenerative medicine.</p><p>The application of stem cells in cancer therapy has been widely investigated because of the high totipotency and indefinite life span of these cells<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>. Stem cells also display intrinsic tropism in tumor sites and can spread through existing migratory pathways and non-typical routes by releasing cytokines, chemokines, and/or growth factors, which function as migration stimulatory signals<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can home to sites of injury and penetrate into tumors<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. In our previous study, MSCs labeled with fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (FMNP) were used for targeted imaging and <italic>in vivo</italic> hyperthermia therapy for gastric cancer<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. Studies have shown that MSCs may improve tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, creating a niche to support the survival of cancer stem cells, suppressing immune responses against tumor cells, and/or promoting cancer metastasis<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. In this regard, new cellular vehicles with tumor-homing property but without tumor growth-promoting effects must be developed. As we previously found that mES cells can target cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>, we believe that hES cells can also target cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. The pluripotent nature of hES cells enables them to differentiate into cell types of all three primary germ lineages; this characteristic presents prospects for stem cell-based therapy for human injuries and degenerative diseases<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>. In particular, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were successfully established in 2007; somatic cells were converted into pluripotent cells by gene transfection methods, which provide potential for establishing controllable man-made stem cells<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>.</p><p>Currently, human iPS cells can be obtained at large scale and exhibit remarkable application prospects in drug selection, mechanism research, and organ regeneration<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>. Nevertheless, few studies have reported the use of human iPS cells as tumor therapeutic reagents. Human iPS cells are considered suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> therapy. First, human iPS cells are effective gene delivery agents because they can deliver siRNA or drugs into tumor sites and inhibit the growth of tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>. Second, human iPS cells can differentiate into immunological cells in tumor sites and thus kill tumor cells<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>. Finally, human iPS cells can destroy the niche of tumor cell proliferation and repress tumor growth<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>. Therefore, the development of human iPS cells for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor therapy provides considerable potential for clinical translation.</p><p>In this study, we utilized the advantages of FMNPs and selected human gastric cancer as treatment target. We prepared FMNP-labeled human iPS cells and investigated their effects on gastric cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Combined with treatment under an external magnetic field, FMNP-labeled iPS cells can be used for synergistic therapy for gastric cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. FMNP-labeled iPS cells also can be used for therapy of other tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms need to be verified.</p><p>FMNPs presents two interesting features, namely, fluorescence and superparamagnetism, which render these particles to be suitable for various applications, such as in bio-labeling, tracking of stem cell migration, biological separation, target imaging, drug delivery, and localized hyperthermia of tumors<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>.

Our results also confirmed that the prepared FMNPs exhibit good biocompatibility and are thus suitable for clinical applications.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of FMNP-labeled iPS cells in treating gastric cancer <italic>in vitro</italic>, we hypothesize that iPS cells secreted several specific anti-cancer factors into the culture medium; these factors can directly kill gastric cancer cells or regulate their growth by activating or inhibiting several specific pathways. Although the existence of this phenomenon was confirmed by our results, the identity of these factors and their functions remain unknown. Further work is therefore necessary.</p><p>The mechanism of FMNP-labeled iPS cells targeting gastric cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> includes the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and/or growth factors into the blood or lymph circulation, which serve as candidate migration stimulatory signals. Some receptors on the iPS cell surface or iPS cells may secrete cytokines and chemokines, which combine with factors secreted by tumor cells; this phenomenon induces iPS cells to move to the tumor sites and is similar to the tropism of MSCs<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism must be elucidated.</p><p>As iPS cells can actively target and recognize gastric cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and may localize around the tumor site, FMNPs inside iPS cells can also localize around the tumor cells. FMNPs can produce heat energy when subjected under external magnetic field; in tumor sites, a high temperature of 62 &#x000b0;C was generated and this temperature can kill and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. However, in important organs, such as liver or kidney or lung, a temperature of 30 &#x000b0;C was generated, which cannot damage important organs. Therefore, the prepared FMNPs-labeled iPS cells could achieve the cancer therapy effect, which presents good clinical application prospects. The therapeutic effects of FMNP-labeled iPS cells coupled with the hyperthermal effects of FMNPs demonstrate a significant potential for clinical treatment of cancer.</p><p>Furthermore, iPS cells inhibit cancer cell proliferation. The possible mechanism of iPS cells as a therapeutic agent for cancer mainly focuses on the following aspects: (I) iPS cells could produce numerous functional cells in tumor sites, and these cells can establish a normal relationship to tumor cells, deliver inhibitory factors to the tumor cells, and consequently inhibit tumor cell proliferation<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>. (II) iPS cells could regenerate different kinds of immunocytes, such as NK cells, activated macrophages, and cytolytic T cells. These regenerated cells could supply immunocytes into the tumor-bearing body and kill tumor cells<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref>. (III) New functional cells produced by iPS cells could improve the microenvironment of the body and suppress cancer development<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref>. Meanwhile, high concentrations of the differentiated signals could inhibit tumor cell growth. (IV) iPS cells could also regenerate new functional cells, which can restore immunity and quickly revive senescent cells, thereby preventing the occurrence of cancer<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>.
