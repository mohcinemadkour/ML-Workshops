Furthermore, post-transplantation HCV recurrence is characterized by high levels of HCV replication and accelerated necro-inflammation and fibrosis, significantly lower survival rates relative to those of non-HCV infected transplant recipients, and limited treatment options. Recurrence is ubiquitous if HCV infection is not eradicated prior to liver transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although pre-transplantation treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin can prevent allograft re-infection if a sustained viral response (SVR) is achieved, treatment is limited by poor tolerability and low efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The low efficacy of this regimen can be increased by the addition of first-generation HCV protease inhibitors (boceprevir and telaprevir); however, early discontinuation and hepatic decompensation rates complicate therapy with therapies that include protease inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has also been shown that the addition of the recently approved protease inhibitor simeprevir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] can improve viral response rates with peginterferon/ribavirin to a greater degree than boceprevir or telaprevir, and both are well tolerated when administered in conjunction with peginterferon/ribavirin regimens.</p><p>In the post-transplantation setting, initiation and maintenance of therapy with peginterferon/ribavirin in patients with recurrent HCV is complicated by several factors, including clinical characteristics that preclude full-dose therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], dose reductions (in 30&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% of patients) and premature discontinuations (in 20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of patients) due to adverse events (AEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], low SVR rates (approximately 20&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and interferon-related immune-mediated allograft dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, concomitant use of the current first-generation protease inhibitors in regimens for the treatment of recurrent HCV in liver transplant recipients is complicated by potentially severe drug&#x02013;drug interactions (DDIs) with immunosuppressants, such as the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus, for which there is a lifelong requirement. The narrow therapeutic windows of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus&#x02014;coupled with the facts that both are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and cyclosporine is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]&#x02014;imply that careful selection of concomitant therapies is required. For example, telaprevir has been shown to cause significant increases in the systemic exposures to both cyclosporine (4.6-fold) and tacrolimus (70-fold) in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>It is clear, therefore, that any direct-acting antiviral agent that is to be used concomitantly with immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus must have a favourable pharmacokinetic DDI profile in addition to good efficacy and tolerability. It has been shown that no clinically relevant DDIs occur between cyclosporine or tacrolimus and either simeprevir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or sofosbuvir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Daclatasvir, a HCV NS5A inhibitor with potent pan-genotypic (genotypes 1&#x02013;6) antiviral activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], has been evaluated in over 5500 patients in combinations with other direct-acting antivirals and peginterferon/ribavirin (data on file; study no. DACL-001). Daclatasvir has a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once-daily dosing without food restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], is a substrate of both CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and P-gp, and has a low potential for clinically significant DDIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, concentrations of unbound daclatasvir are not affected to a clinically significant level by moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment, and dose adjustment is not required for this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Only limited clinical data on the use of daclatasvir in transplant recipients concomitantly taking calcineurin inhibitors are available at the current time. Daclatasvir has been used successfully in combination with sofosbuvir as part of a direct-acting antiviral-only regimen without signs of a significant DDI with tacrolimus in a transplant recipient with severe recurrent cholestatic HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Daclatasvir has also been used successfully in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin without signs of a significant DDI with cyclosporine in a transplant recipient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of multiple doses of daclatasvir on the single-dose pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, two-group study in healthy subjects.

The dosing schedules differed between the two groups to allow for a wash-out of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus prior to steady-state daclatasvir dosing.</p><p>All subjects were required to fast for 10&#x000a0;h prior to dosing; fasting continued until 4&#x000a0;h post-dose on days when pharmacokinetic sampling (described below) and clinical laboratory tests were performed (group 1, day 11; group 2, day 19), and until 2&#x000a0;h post-dose on all other days. With the exception of 240&#x000a0;mL of water ingested with dosing, subjects refrained from drinking water from 1&#x000a0;h pre-dose until 1&#x000a0;h post-dose; water was consumed ad libitum at other times.

On the basis that daclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and a moderate inhibitor of P-gp, cyclosporine is a substrate and inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and tacrolimus is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it was anticipated that co-administration of daclatasvir with cyclosporine or tacrolimus would not affect the systemic exposures to either cyclosporine or tacrolimus; it was also expected that while tacrolimus would not affect the systemic exposure to daclatasvir, cyclosporine might do so.</p><p>The results of this study support these expectations. There was no effect of concomitant multiple doses of daclatasvir on the single-dose exposure to either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. These results suggest that weak-to-moderate inhibition of P-gp by daclatasvir has minimal impacts on the absorption, disposition and excretion of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in&#x000a0;vivo. Although a concomitant single dose of tacrolimus did not affect the multiple-dose exposure to daclatasvir, concomitant administration of a single dose of cyclosporine with multiple doses of daclatasvir resulted in increases in the systemic exposure (AUC) and trough concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>24</sub>) of daclatasvir; <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was unaffected. The increases in the daclatasvir AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>24</sub> were not considered to be clinically meaningful, on the basis that no exposure&#x02013;safety relationship was observed during phase&#x000a0;3 dose selection using pharmacokinetic data from multiple studies (daclatasvir dose range 1&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg once daily and 30&#x000a0;mg twice daily)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Among the 694 patients in the population pharmacokinetic model who were within the 4th quartile of steady-state exposures, 13&#x000a0;% of patients had daclatasvir exposures (&#x0003e;22,000&#x000a0;ng&#x000b7;h/mL) approximately threefold higher than those observed here, with no unique safety signals observed in this subgroup. Thus, the 40&#x000a0;% increase in exposure observed in this study was well within the range of exposure estimated from the population pharmacokinetic assessment conducted in the phase 2/3 programme using the same data. These data support the use of daclatasvir in transplant recipients and are consistent with observations that when a DDI is observed with daclatasvir, daclatasvir is usually the victim and not the perpetrator of the DDI.</p><p>While the results of this study support the concomitant use of daclatasvir with calcineurin inhibitors, it is important to note that only single doses of cyclosporine and tacrolimus were used in this study, to limit the potential for prolonged immunosuppression in healthy subjects. However, the single doses of cyclosporine and tacrolimus used in this study delivered exposures comparable to those observed for the therapeutic ranges of these medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and thus these study findings can be extrapolated to the clinical setting of a cyclosporine or tacrolimus multiple dosing scenario. Additionally, a high dose of cyclosporine (400&#x000a0;mg) was used in this study to maximize the probability that if cyclosporine impacted the pharmacokinetics of daclatasvir, such observations would be made.</p><p>The use of high doses of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in this study contrasted with those used in the assessment of DDIs with telaprevir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During the assessment of DDIs with telaprevir, in which a DDI was anticipated, single doses of cyclosporine 100 and 10&#x000a0;mg were used during treatment with cyclosporine alone and cyclosporine in addition to telaprevir, respectively; tacrolimus 2 and 0.5&#x000a0;mg were similarly used. During this study, concomitant administration of telaprevir resulted in 4.6 and 70-fold increases in the exposure to cyclosporine and tacrolimus, respectively, which represented potentially fatal increases in cyclosporine and tacrolimus exposure; approximately fivefold increases in the <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus were also observed, which indicates the potential for drug accumulation in the clinical setting when multiple doses are used. Furthermore, the degree of the interactions between telaprevir and cyclosporine or tacrolimus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were comparable to those observed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors and cyclosporine or tacrolimus, co-administration of which requires significant modifications to both the dosing level and dosing interval of cyclosporine or tacrolimus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the current study, which revealed no clinically meaningful interactions, the concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus were 40 and 10-fold higher, respectively, than those used by Garg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The use of daclatasvir in transplant recipients has also been reported in two published case reports. Daclatasvir has been used successfully in combination with sofosbuvir as part of a direct-acting antiviral-only regimen without signs of a significant DDI with tacrolimus in a transplant recipient with severe recurrent cholestatic HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin without signs of a significant DDI with cyclosporine in a transplant recipient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the ability to use daclatasvir without dose adjustments in subjects with hepatic impairment [the unbound daclatasvir AUC values in subjects with Child&#x02013;Pugh class B (moderate) and class C (severe) hepatic impairment were within 5&#x000a0;% of the unbound daclatasvir AUC values in healthy subjects] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] offers a simple treatment option for patients approaching the need for liver transplantation (where a rapid reduction in viral load is required) and for patients who have received a liver transplant and require further antiviral therapy. Both populations are considered to have high unmet clinical needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study indicate that daclatasvir can be used in conjunction with cyclosporine or tacrolimus in transplant recipients, with dose modification unlikely to be required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the research staff at the participating sites and thank the subjects and their families for their assistance with conducting this study (funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb).
