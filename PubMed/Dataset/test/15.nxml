One peptide scored highest in all three algorithms, and the high HLA-A2-binding affinity of this peptide was verified in an HLA stabilization assay. By stimulation with peptide-loaded dendritic cells a CTL clone was established, which was able to kill two breast cancer cell lines in an HLA-A2-dependent and peptide-specific manner, demonstrating presentation of the peptide on the surface of cancer cells. Furthermore, blood from cancer patients and healthy donors was screened for spontaneous T-cell reactivity against the peptide in IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assays. Patients with breast cancer, malignant melanoma, or renal cell carcinoma hosted powerful and high-frequency T-cell responses against the peptide. In addition, when blood from healthy donors was tested, similar responses were observed. Ultimately, serum from cancer patients and healthy donors was analyzed for anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. Humoral responses against cyclin B1 were frequently detected in both cancer patients and healthy donors. In conclusion, a high-affinity cyclin B1-derived HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope was identified, which was presented on the cell surface of cancer cells, and elicited spontaneous T-cell responses in cancer patients and healthy donors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cyclin B1</kwd><kwd>Tumor-associated antigen</kwd><kwd>Cytotoxic T cells</kwd><kwd>Anti-cancer vaccination</kwd><kwd>CTL epitope</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that tumor cells express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and that TAA-derived peptides are presented in context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and recognized by T cells. A high number of TAAs have been characterized and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes from these identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several of these epitopes have been tested in clinical vaccination trials, and some promising clinical responses have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, clinical responses remain infrequent; thus, therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination has not yet met its promise. One reason is the ability of cancer cells to escape the immune system by loss or down-regulation of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To this end, targeting of TAAs important for survival and growth of tumor cells (such as for example survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) may minimize the risk of tumor immune escape.</p><p>Cyclin B1 is one of the key regulators of the cell cycle, regulating the transition from G<sub>2</sub> to M phase in complex with the cyclin-dependent protein kinase cdc2. Cyclin B1 expression initiates during S-phase, peaks at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase, and at the end of mitosis cyclin B1 is rapidly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cyclin B1 is needed for cells to enter mitosis, and therefore essential for growth of all cells, including tumor cells. Thus, immune escape by down-regulation or loss of expression of cyclin B1 would impair sustained tumor cell growth. As a consequence, cyclin B1 is an attractive target for anti-cancer immune therapy.</p><p>In normal cells, cyclin B1 is expressed at almost undetectable levels; however, many tumors express high constitutive levels of cyclin B1, which causes uncontrolled tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This overexpression has been observed in several human solid tumors, for example, breast cancer (BC), malignant melanoma (MM), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as some hematological cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In normal cells, cyclin B1 is restricted to the nucleus, whereas it accumulates in the cytoplasm in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This causes increased degradation by the ubiquitin pathway, which leads to increased presentation of cyclin B1-derived peptides on the surface of cancer cells compared with normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which in turn may lead to more efficient T-cell recognition. The overexpression of cyclin B1 as well as the cytoplasmic localisation in cancer cells compared with normal cells makes cyclin B1 a good target candidate for anti-cancer immune therapy.</p><p>The cyclin B1-derived T-cell epitopes described so far have been of low HLA-binding affinity. In the present study, a high-affinity cyclin B1-derived peptide restricted by HLA-A2 was selected using in silico peptide prediction algorithms. The predicted high binding affinity to HLA-A2 was validated experimentally, and a CTL clone was established that was able to kill cyclin B1-overexpressing BC cell lines in an HLA-A2-dependent and peptide-specific manner. Also, peptide-specific spontaneous CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses as well as anti-cyclin B1 antibody responses were observed in both healthy donors and patients with BC, MM, or RCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cancer patients and healthy donors</title><p>Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from end-stage BC patients, RCC patients, and MM patients were used in the study.

It synthesizes HLA-A2.1 and HLA-B51.1, but does not express normal amounts on the cell surface due to lack of functional transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) heterodimers. The cell lines MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26) and CAMA-1 (HTB-21) are HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> BC cell lines, and ZR-75-1 (CRL-1500) is an HLA-A2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> BC cell line. K562 (CCL-243) is a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, which is HLA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and sensitive to NK-cell-mediated killing. All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GibcoBRL) containing 10% FCS. All cell lines are routinely tested for mycoplasma using a PCR-based method, and the morphology is checked visually by microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Peptides and peptide prediction</title><p>The Cyclin B1-derived peptide CB204 (ILIDWLVQV) and the control peptide HIV-1 pol<sub>476-484</sub> (ILKEPVHGV) were both purchased from GenScript Corporation.

In short, the HLA stabilization assay is based on stabilization of HLA class I molecules after loading of different concentrations of peptide. T2 cells were metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine (Amersham). Stably folded HLA class I molecules were immune-precipitated and separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel electrophoresis. HLA heavy chain bands were quantified using the FLA-3000 phosphorimager and the Multi Gauge V3.1 software from Fujifilm. The intensity of each band is directly related to the amount of peptide-HLA class I complex recovered during the assay. The recovery of HLA-A2 was measured in the presence of 40, 4, 0.4, and 0.04&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of the relevant peptide, and compared with the high-affinity HIV-1 pol<sub>476&#x02013;484</sub> peptide.

Cyclin B1 represents such a protein, and Kao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have described immunogenic, HLA-A2-restricted peptides derived from cyclin B1. These peptides were characterized by elution of peptides from cancer cells; thus, the expression of the peptides on the cell surface of cancer cells was firmly established. The epitopes identified were, however, of low affinity to HLA. In the present study, reverse immunology was used to identify a high-affinity CTL epitope. First, the amino acid sequence of the cyclin B1 protein was screened for the most probable HLA-A2 nonameric peptide epitopes using different CTL epitope prediction algorithms. The peptide CB204 was selected and an HLA stabilization assay showed that the peptide had very high affinity for HLA-A2. To verify the presence of the peptide on the cell surface of cancer cells, a CB204-specific CTL clone was established. The clone was able to lyse cyclin B1-overexpressing tumor cells in a peptide-specific and HLA-A2-restricted manner, showing that CB204 was presented in context of HLA-A2 molecules on the surface of cancer cells.</p><p>Additionally, we detected spontaneous T-cell responses against the CB204 peptide in 73% of the cancer patients tested and 90% of the healthy donors that were analyzed. These cells were most likely of an antigen-experienced phenotype, since they were able to produce IFN-&#x003b3; upon stimulation with the CB204 peptide alone. Furthermore, anti-cyclin B1 antibody responses were detected in all cancer patients and healthy donors analyzed, but it was, as mentioned, not possible to determine the cut-off between true positive and negative individuals in the ELISA assay. Nevertheless, frequent humoral responses against cyclin B1 were detected in both patients and healthy donors.</p><p>There were, however, no correlation between the T-cell responses and the antibody responses detected in the patients. Also, there was no correlation between patient disease progression/prior therapies/age and immune responses.</p><p>Cyclin B1-specific T cells and antibodies in cancer patients have been observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, Vella and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported the presence of cyclin B1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in healthy donors. These T cells in healthy donors were also antigen-experienced based on their IFN-&#x003b3; production. They also detected anti-cyclin B1 antibodies (IgG) in the healthy donors, corresponding with our results. Suzuki and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] detected significantly lower levels of anti-cyclin B1 antibody in healthy donors than in cancer patients. This is contrary to our findings, where the levels were similar in all individuals. This difference may be explained by different assay protocols and use of different secondary antibodies. Suzuki and coworkers used an antibody detecting IgM, IgG, and IgA, whereas we only detected IgG. Maybe the predominant isotype in healthy donors is IgG, and in cancer patients the other isotypes are dominant as well.</p><p>In addition to cyclin B1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and antibodies, Vella et al. also reported the presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in healthy donors. Thus, there seems to be extensive both humoral and cellular immune responses against cyclin B1 in healthy donors as well as cancer patients. This could indicate that anti-cancer immune therapy targeting cyclin B1 would be safe and not cause autoimmunity. Furthermore, the level of peptide-HLA complexes on the cell surface of normal cells is possibly too low to reach the threshold for immune detection. However, in cancer cells, overexpression of cyclin B1 leads to increased presentation of the peptide on the cell surface and thus T-cell recognition. This difference in expression would explain why cyclin B1-specific T cells in healthy donors do not cause autoimmunity, and why T-cell responses against normal cells should not be expected in cancer patients treated with cyclin B1-targeted immunotherapy. However, the question as to why cyclin B1 &#x02014;and some other TAA&#x02014;elicits immune responses in normal healthy donors remains elusive.</p><p>In the study by Vella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], mice bearing cyclin B1-overexpressing tumors were vaccinated using a protein-based vaccination strategy. They observed induction of cyclin B1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and antibodies, lower tumor volume, increased survival of the mice, and no signs of autoimmunity. Although this was a mouse study and long-term effects could not be studied, it strongly supports cyclin B1 as an ideal target for anti-cancer vaccination and also indicates that it would be safe to induce an immune response directed against cyclin B1.</p><p>Besides indicating that cyclin B1-targeted anti-cancer immune therapy is safe, responses in healthy donors may also indicate that cyclin B1-targeted anti-cancer vaccination would have a higher efficacy due to a higher precursor frequency of cyclin B1-specific T cells. Rizzutto and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] recently reported that, in mice, there is a correlation between the frequency of self-antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell precursors and the quality of the anti-cancer immune response. Mice challenged with the melanoma cell line B16F10 were adoptively administered different numbers of gp100-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from pmel-1 transgenic mice. Afterwards, the mice received three weekly vaccinations with plasmid encoding gp100. This experiment showed that gp100-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell precursor frequency was a significant predictor of treatment outcome. They observed both a better proliferation of autologous antigen-specific T cells in the mice, and also a higher frequency of poly-functional effector cells. In addition, the treated mice had a longer tumor-free survival period, and a higher frequency of memory cells 85&#x000a0;days after the last vaccination. If this translates to humans, cyclin B1 responses in healthy donors may be a good prognostic factor for successful anti-cancer vaccination. The fact that immune reactivity against cyclin B1 is observed in healthy donors could mean that cancer patients have a higher frequency of cyclin B1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell precursors in the blood, in turn leading to a higher efficacy of cyclin B1-targeted anti-cancer vaccination.</p><p>In conclusion, cyclin B1 is a promising target for anti-cancer vaccination and maybe even for adoptive transfer of cyclin B1-specific T cells. Further studies should therefore be performed, aiming at characterizing cyclin B1-specific T cells in healthy donors further, as well as identifying CTL epitopes restricted to other HLA-alleles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was financially supported by The Danish Cancer Society, Danielsen Foundation, Danish Medical Research Council, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the John and Birthe Meyer Foundation, and the Toyota Foundation.
