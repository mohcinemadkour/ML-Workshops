Physical examination, including endoscopy should be combined with technical radiologic imaging to record the precise extent of tumour. The TNM staging system of the head and neck region is, in fact, an anatomic staging system that describes the anatomic extent of the primary tumour as well as the involvement of regional lymph nodes and distant metastases. Modifications in the TNM staging system should consider not only the expert opinions and published reports in the literature but the technical advances in technology for improved assessment of tumour extent and the shifting paradigms in therapeutic strategies. &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; stage of the tumour is defined by its size, the depth of the invasion and the involvement of vital structures. In the 7th edition of TNM classification, for stage T4 tumors (larger than 4&#x000a0;cm), subcategories a and b were introduced to indicate the involvement of vital structures and their suitability for surgical resection (except for nasopharynx cancer). Nodal metastasis is the most important predictor of outcome for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.</p><p>Better and more reliable methods of pretreatment tumour assessment are therefore crucial to ensure that the clinical assessment of tumor approximates its actual pathologic extent.</p><p>CT and MRI are both useful for assessing extensions of pharyngeal- and oral cavity cancer in advanced stage.

The male Ph-OC-Ca mortality is fourth in all cancer mortality in Hungary.</p><p>The majority of mucosal cancers in this country are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCA). Like in most cancers, the prognosis mainly depends on the stage of the tumour.</p><p>Head and neck (HN) is a difficult region, both its anatomy and pathology is very complex, various connection points may exist between the sites that determines the extension of disease.</p><p>Evaluation of Clinical Stage is based primarily on inspection, and palpation of the sites and on indirect and direct endoscopy. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is also required in advanced stage. Complete endoscopy, usually under general anesthesia, is performed after completion of other staging studies.</p><p>Imaging plays a crucial role in defining the extension of cancer and in therapy planning, as well. The accuracy of image evaluation depends very much on the experience and competence of radiologists. They have to be familiar with the anatomy and pathology of this region and the clinical details of the patient as well, in order to determine the most accurate stage of tumour.</p></sec><sec><title>Review</title><sec><title>Basic aspects in the management of advanced head and neck cancer</title><p>There are new aspects in management of advanced Ph-OC-CA. One of the major endpoints of interest in management is to improve the quality of life, to preserve organ function without compromising survival. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are considered as standards in treatment, but not all patients are suitable for organ preservation therapy. Patients with no response to standard therapy have to undergo salvage surgery. Criteria of inoperability have changed, consequently at present more extented resections and reconstructions are performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Tthe 3D-conformal-, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), for its better technical capacity, has resulted in a reduction of the dose delivered to normal tissues because of focusing more precisely on the target volumes. This means that more accurate assessment of tumour borders and tumour volume as well as of biological target volume is required in therapy planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Changes in treatment strategy of advanced HN cancer, necessitate more accurate radiological evaluation, knowledge of more tumour characteristics and prognostic factors.</p><p>It is crucial to ensure that the radiological diagnosis of the tumour status is concordant with the actual pathological status.</p></sec><sec><title>Prognostic factors</title><p>Prognostic Factors affect patient&#x02019;s survival and modify the therapeutic strategies. Tumour-related prognostic factors are: the primary tumour (T) size and its depth of invasion, the Grade of tumor, and the presence or absence of vascular invasion, &#x02212; although the latter is particularly not included in the staging of HN tumours, but it should be noted when present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The presence of metastatic lymph nodes (N), and their size, number, and position (level), as well as signs of extracapsular tumour spread (ECS<bold>)</bold> are important prognostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Mediastinal nodal spread is counted as distant metastasis, except those of level VII. The incidence of distant metastatic disease increases with rising tumour stage. Risk of distant metastasis is more dependent on &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; than on &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; status. As a rule, in Ph-OC-CA most metastases (M) develop in the lungs and the bones (rarely in the liver and brain). The data in the literature suggest that the rate of lung metastasis in newly diagnosed head and neck SCCA ranges from 16% to 19% using CT of the thorax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal and adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCA) have an increased risk of developing distant metastases.</p><p>In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the overall health of these patients clearly influences the outcome. In some ongoing studies authors attempt to use both tumour and non-tumour related factors for the better evaluation of prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Principle of the new, 7th TNM cancer staging</title><p>Numerous factors affect patient&#x02019;s survival, including the histologic diagnosis, cellular differentiation of the tumour (grade), location and size, local extension, and the status of regional lymph nodes as well as the presence of distant metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The importance of accurate mapping of the tumour before determining therapy has always been recognized by the Collaborative TNM System of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC). The TNM system is periodically revised in response to newly acquired clinical data reflecting the new therapeutic strategies, improving understanding of cancer biology, and factors affecting prognosis. The revision cycle for TNM staging is 6&#x02013;8 years. This provides sufficient time for the implementation of changes in clinical guidelines and cancer registry and for the discussion of data supporing changes in staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The 7&#x0201d;th TNM Revision is valid from 01, January, 2010 onwards. The anatomic extent of the disease remained the decisive factor in establishing prognosis in Ph-OC-CA.</p><p>The classification involves only four dominant clinical variables: tumour size, local extension of the tumour, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. Histologic grade, patient age and tumor site are important additional factors that should be recorded for future analysis and potential inclusion in the staging system.</p><p>ESMO Guidelines/2010 approved by the ESMO Guidelines Working Group, accepted the new therapy-guided 7th TNM strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The guideline approved T4 tumors subdivision (except for nasopharyngeal cancer) into T4a: moderately advanced lesions and T4b: very advanced lesions with local extension. Clinical prognostic cancer stage IV was divided into: A, B, C subcategories. Stage IVA: moderately advanced (surgically resectable, suitable for salvage operation. Stage IVB: very advanced, &#x0201c;unresectable&#x0201d; are generally acknowledged as indicative of extension of tumor to vital anatomic structures, where surgical resection is either technically not feasible or not recommended however, it is potentially treatable with radio-chemotherapy. Stage IVC: stands for metastatic disease, only for palliative treatment: chemotherapy, radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of imaging in clinical staging</title><p>Clinical staging, based on the best possible imaging technique, estimates the extent of disease before the first treatment. In the last ESMO Guidelines/2010 the diagnostic modalities in clinical staging were determined: physical examination, CT, MRI, HN-endoscopy and chest X-ray. According to the new EHNS-ESMO-ESTRO Clinical Practice: Guidlines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of the squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: MRI is considered the preferable staging procedure for every tumour subsite of the HN - except laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. MRI offers the best soft tissue differentiation, best evaluation of tumour borders, tumour extension, the most optimal evaluation of intracranial, perineural tumour spread, and also enables the radiologist to analyse vascularity. CT imaging with axial and coronal thin section technique using contrast agent is an excellant alternative diagnostic tool in Ph-OC-CA. In many institutions, CT is the preferred imaging method for the routine evaluation of head and neck cancer. In most cases a dedicated CT study will answer most questions of the referring clinician. CT is superior in the routine work to MRI: wide spread use, easy performance, standard reproducibility, relatively low cost, short examination time, resulting less motion artefact, superior information of cortical bone and bone lamellas without marrow space. CT can be regarded as the&#x02019;workhorse&#x02019; of head and neck cancer imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In advanced stage thoracic CT is preferable to exclude lung metastasis or second lung primaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>3&#x000a0;T MR scanners can provide higher resolution images for better tissue definition and can also benefit from MR-spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) applications. MRI is a true cancer imaging biomarker. It may provide more physiologic and functional qualitative and quantitative data using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and can further improve the assessment of target volumes and can provide an opportunity to nominate the biological target volume and the potential to determine treatment response. The diagnostic accuracy of DWI complements anatomical MR imaging for staging neck lymph nodes in head and neck cancer (HNCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The better estimation of target volumes with CT and MRI may permit treatment individualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The superior characterization of soft tissues and better visualization of tumour extent may be benefecial for radiotherapy planning because a more precise delineation of margins for the organ sparing strategies with boosting and dose escalation is feasible. The value of DW-MRI in radiotherapy planning is also under investigation. DW-MRI is able to characterize tissues and generate image contrast based on differences in histological micro-structures non-invasively, and based on water movement, improves the target delineation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>These techniques may also be combined with PET/CT to further increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The role of FDG-PET/CT in staging is under investigation, it has a lower specificity than sensitivity and is more useful for staging distant metastases and synchronous tumour than lymphnode metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The need for extensive imaging to identify metastatic disease depends on the consideration of tumour site, stage of disease and histology. In advanced Ph-OC-CA a careful multimodality imaging search is mandatory also for other primary tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract and because of the higher incidence of multiple independent primary tumours occuring simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>US has been widely used in the assesment of cervical lymph node status, but it is not reliable for the deep nodes. US guided Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USgFNAB) may confirm the tumour, its histopathologic nature, but it cannot rule out the presence of tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Key points in the evaluation of different Ph-OC-CA</title><sec><title>Oral cavity cancers (OCCA)</title><p>The oral cavity is divided into the following specific sites:</p><p>Mucosal Lip (40% of OCCs), Buccal Mucosa, Lower Alveolar Ridge, Upper Alveolar Ridge, Retromolar Gingiva (Retromolar Trigone), Floor of the Mouth (15% of OCCs).</p><p>Hard Palate (5% of OCCs), Anterior two-thirds of the tongue (Oral Tongue, 20% of OCCs) The tongue is most commonly involved in the middle, and in the posterior third, mainly on the lateral, and lower surface. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA is prevalent in about 50% of oral cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In OCCA submucosal spread is common. Tumours of each anatomic site have their own predictable patterns of regional spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The region of the retromolar trigone has important connection to the neighbouring cervical spaces, along the mandible to the pterygomandibular space and on this way to the parapharyngeal space till the skull base. Perineural spread may also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The tongue is richly supplied with lymphatics, nearly half of patients have N metastases, 30%o of them are bilateral at the initial clinical presentation. Many of these nodes are clinically silent, detected only by imaging. Tumour thickness is also a prognostic factor that predicts subclinical nodal metastasis, local recurrence and patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Clinical assessment of the extent of superficial mucosal involvement is more accurate than the radiographic assessment. MRI/CT are useful in evaluation of advanced tumours for the estimation of deep invasion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). MRI is more accurate visualizing the extent of perivascular and perineural spread, skull base involvement, and intracranial tumour extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. High-resolution CT images may provide additional information on bone and larynx details and they are minimally affected by motion artefact.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Oral cavity cancer, located in the sublingual region, stage T4aN2c.

A particular advantage of cross-sectional imaging is the ability to detect deep tumor extension or the presence or absence of metastases that cannot be judged by clinical examination. &#x0201c;Stage migration&#x0201d; occurs when patients are assigned to different clinical stages because of differences in the accuracy of the clinical examinations and imaging staging methods.
