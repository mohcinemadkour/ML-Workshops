Numerous studies have shown that stimulation of the host immune system can result in the generation of anti-tumor immune responses capable of controlling metastatic tumor growth. Thus, there is interest in the development of combination therapies that both control primary tumor growth and stimulate anti-tumor immunity for control of metastatic disease and subsequent tumor growth. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an FDA-approved anticancer modality that has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Augmentation of anti-tumor immunity by PDT is regimen dependent, and PDT regimens that enhance anti-tumor immunity have been defined. Unfortunately, these regimens have limited ability to control primary tumor growth. Therefore, a two-step combination therapy was devised in which a tumor-controlling PDT regimen was combined with an immune-enhancing PDT regimen. To determine whether the two-step combination therapy enhanced anti-tumor immunity, resistance to subsequent tumor challenge and T cell activation and function was measured. The ability to control distant disease was also determined. The results showed that the novel combination therapy stimulated anti-tumor immunity while retaining the ability to inhibit primary tumor growth of both murine colon (Colon26-HA) and mammary (4T1) carcinomas. The combination therapy resulted in enhanced tumor-specific T cell activation and controlled metastatic tumor growth. These results suggest that PDT may be an effective adjuvant for therapies that fail to stimulate the host anti-tumor immune response.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Photodynamic therapy</kwd><kwd>Anti-tumor immunity</kwd><kwd>Combination therapy</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a multi-faceted disease, and although therapeutic outcomes have improved over the decades and single treatment modalities are generally effective at controlling the primary tumor, they have little effect on distant disease. This has led to the development of combination therapies that strive to both control primary tumor growth and activate the host immune system to combat distant disease. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an FDA-approved anticancer modality used for treatment of early stage disease and palliation of advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Treatment is carried out by systemic administration of a photosensitizer that is activated locally with tissue-penetrating visible light, resulting in tumor destruction via oxygen-dependent direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, vascular damage, and the initiation of acute local and systemic inflammation. The photosensitizer dose, light dose, and light dose-rate define the PDT regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that PDT efficacy is dependent upon the presence of an intact immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and that certain PDT regimens can enhance anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>PDT-enhanced anti-tumor immunity is mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is accompanied by enhanced CTL-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, formation of immune memory cells, and resistance to subsequent tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion or tumor cell loss of molecules needed for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recognition [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules] result in reduced PDT efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PDT-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also play a critical role in PDT-mediated control of secondary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PDT enhancement of CTL activation and anti-tumor immunity is dependent upon induction of acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>PDT-induced acute inflammation is characterized by rapid migration of neutrophils into the treated tumor bed and tumor-draining lymph nodes and enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The degree of acute inflammation induced by PDT is regimen dependent and correlates with the degree of vascular damage induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Henderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] demonstrated that PDT regimens that result in rapid cell death (within 1&#x000a0;h of treatment) and maximal tissue damage cause minimal acute inflammation, presumably because of vascular shut down, which prevents neutrophil infiltration and systemic release of cytokines. In contrast, regimens that cause diffuse tumor damage permit neutrophil infiltration and allow for expression and release of inflammatory mediators critical for enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. However, the diffuse tumor damage caused by these regimens resulted in less effective long-term tumor control.</p><p>Combination therapies take advantage of the complementary action of the individual components, thereby potentiating the therapeutic effect. We hypothesized that it would be possible to devise a PDT-only therapy using distinctly different, but complimentary, treatment regimens that in combination would enhanced anti-tumor immunity as well as provide effective control of primary tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we devised a multi-step local treatment program that was comprised of an immune-enhancing PDT regimen followed by a tumor ablation PDT regimen. Results presented here demonstrate that this program was able to control the growth of murine colon and mammary tumors and to promote anti-tumor immunity that was effective against distant disease. These studies demonstrate that PDT-only therapies can be developed that are effective as both a local therapy for control of primary disease and a systemic therapy for treatment of distant disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and tumor system</title><p>Pathogen-free BALB/c mice were obtained from the NCI; <italic>scid</italic> mice were obtained from the Roswell Park Department of Laboratory Animal Resources.

These treatment regimens also ablated the tumor vasculature, and treated tumors showed widespread areas of apoptosis that was accompanied by prolonged caspase 3 activation. In contrast, regimens that elicited acute inflammation and strong anti-tumor immunity preserved the tumor vasculature, resulted in minimal long-term tumor growth control, limited areas of apoptosis, and transient caspase 3 activation. Therefore, we refer to these treatments as immune enhancing, while those regimens that effectively control tumor growth, but result in minimal enhancement of anti-tumor immunity, are referred to as tumor-controlling regimens. We hypothesized that treating tumors with an immune-enhancing PDT regimen followed by a tumor-controlling PDT regimen could lead to enhancement of anti-tumor immunity, while retaining effective control of primary tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, a combination treatment regimen was devised in which Colo26-HA tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were treated with a HPPH-PDT regimen known to lead to enhanced anti-tumor immunity (0.4 &#x003bc;moles/kg HPPH followed 18&#x000a0;h later by illumination with 665&#x000a0;nm light for a total dose of 48&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). Following illumination, mice were rested for 9&#x000a0;days; on the ninth day, mice were injected with HPPH. On day 10 following the first treatment, tumors were treated with a tumor control treatment regimen (illumination with 665&#x000a0;nm light for a total dose of 132&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]).</p><p>PDT efficacy depends on the intensity and distribution of light in the tumor. We were concerned that the initial PDT exposure might change the optical properties of the tumor tissue and perturb the effectiveness of the subsequent PDT exposure. Therefore, we measured light transmission through Colo26-HA tumors immediately before both the first and the second PDT treatments and compared their calculated optical penetration depths (characterized by &#x003b4;, the distance over which diffuse light decreases in intensity to 1/e or 37&#x000a0;% of its initial value) through tumor tissue. Light penetration measured immediately before the second PDT treatment was slightly greater than that determined before the first PDT treatment (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sub>PDT1</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.80&#x000a0;mm, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sub>PDT2</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.06&#x000a0;mm), but that difference was not statistically significant. Thus, prior treatment with an immune-enhancing PDT regimen does not alter the optical properties of the tumor tissue.</p><p>We next tested whether prior treatment with an immune-enhancing PDT regimen altered effectiveness of tumor-controlling PDT regimens. Colo26-HA tumor-bearing mice were treated with the combination therapy (immune-enhancing PDT followed 10&#x000a0;days later with tumor-controlling PDT). Animals bearing tumors of an equivalent size to the regrowing tumors present in the animals treated initially with immune-enhancing PDT at the time of the second HPPH injection (9&#x000a0;days following delivery of the initial immune-enhancing PDT regimen) were also injected with HPPH and were treated 18&#x000a0;h later with the tumor control PDT regimen or were treated with 665&#x000a0;nm light for a total dose of 48&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> or 135&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Tumor growth was monitored for 60&#x000a0;days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). All treatments resulted in significant tumor control when compared to the control treatment with either HPPH or light alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.001); for simplicity sake, the tumor growth response of tumors treated with light alone is not depicted.

In the current study, we combine an immune-enhancing PDT regimen with a tumor growth-controlling PDT regimen in order to develop a single modality combination therapy that would both control primary tumor growth and stimulate the host immune system to modulate growth of distant disease. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with this novel combination therapy resulted in efficacious tumor growth control, increased numbers of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and tumor-specific cytotoxicity, and an increased in resistance to subsequent tumor challenge and metastatic tumor growth. Enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by the combination treatment regimen occurred when either HPPH- or PII-PDT was used. Additionally, colon and mammary carcinoma models exhibited regimen-dependent host responses. This suggests that these findings may be applicable across photosensitizers and that it may be possible to identify immune-enhancing PDT regimens in multiple tumor models.</p><p>The mechanism of the dose-dependent induction of inflammation and subsequent enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by PDT is unclear. Previous studies by Henderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have suggested that treatment of tumors with high-dose PDT regimens result in vascular ablation that prevents infiltration of the tumor bed by innate immune cell and limits acute inflammation. Initiation of inflammation and subsequent stimulation of anti-tumor immunity have been linked to the recognition of alarmins by innate immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Alarmins include damage-associated pattern proteins (DAMPs) and metabolites released or expressed on the cell surface by damaged and transformed cells, as well as cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b1;. Alarmins are released following PDT and have been linked to generation of inflammation and anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Recent studies by Tracy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] have demonstrated that PDT dose influences the release of alarmins. Significantly at high doses, in vitro PDT treatment of tumor cells leads to an inactivation of alarmins and a reduction in the release of inflammatory mediators by stromal cells. In contrast, Garg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] showed that expression of a cell surface-associated DAMP, calreticulin, increased with PDT dose; however, the ability of ecto-calreticulin induced by high-dose PDT to induce inflammation was not tested.</p><p>Once activated in the lymph node, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become either effector or memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Effector cells leave the lymph node and migrate to the tumor site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; memory cells migrate to secondary lymphoid organs (central memory T cells) or non-lymphoid tissues (effector memory T cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We have previously shown that there is an increase in activated tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the treated tumor bed 7&#x000a0;days after treatment with the immune-enhancing PDT regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Activated, proliferating T cells are susceptible to PDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; therefore, it was possible that treatment of tumors with a second PDT regimen 10&#x000a0;days after treatment with the immune-enhancing PDT regimen would result in elimination of tumor-specific T cells, which may prevent resistance to subsequent tumor challenge. However, mice treated with the combination therapy were able to control tumor growth when challenged 60&#x000a0;days following treatment, demonstrating a persistence of anti-tumor immunity and strongly suggesting the presence of long lived memory T cells.</p><p>Importantly, the enhancement of immune reactivity to Colo26 tumors by either the immune-enhancing or combination PDT regimens was not limited to recognition of an over-expressed surrogate antigen, confirming our previous preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating that PDT enhances immune recognition of endogenous tumor antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Similarly, Mroz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] showed that vascular PDT regimens enhanced immune reactivity against the endogenous cancer/testis antigen PA1; although this treatment regimen was unable to augment anti-tumor immunity against endogenous tumor antigens in Colo26 tumors.</p><p>Treatment of either the colon or mammary tumor model with the combination therapy resulted in effective control of primary tumor growth; in the case of the Colo26-HA tumor model, there was no significant difference in primary tumor growth following treatment with the tumor growth-controlling PDT regimen and the combination therapy regardless of the photosensitizer used. In contrast, the combination therapy controlled primary 4T1 tumor growth significantly better than single treatment with the tumor-controlling PDT regimen. The reason for this difference is unclear. One possibility is that although tumor size was controlled such that the tumors treated with the single dose of tumor-controlling PDT regimen were of similar size to those treated 10&#x000a0;days following the immune-controlling PDT regimen in the combination therapy, the immune-controlling PDT regimen sensitized the orthotopic tumors to PDT in some manner. The immune-controlling PDT regimen induces a strong local inflammatory response, which could be responsible for this alteration. Studies are currently underway to address this possibility.</p><p>Orthotopic 4T1 tumors rapidly metastasize to the lung and liver within 21&#x000a0;days of inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We and others have previously shown that PDT-enhanced anti-tumor immunity can control distant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The combination therapy was also able to control 4T1 tumor metastases; although the control was not entirely dependent upon the immune system as control was significantly but not completely ablated when the combination therapy was performed in <italic>scid</italic> mice. Metastatic tumor growth was also partially controlled following surgical removal of the primary tumor and treatment with tumor-controlling PDT regimens; this control was independent of anti-tumor immunity. The number of lung tumors present increases with the size of the primary 4T1 and the amount of time the tumor is present in the animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the adaptive immune system-independent reduction in metastatic tumor growth is due to the absence of the primary tumor following surgical removal or treatment-induced reduction in primary tumor growth following treatment with the tumor growth-controlling PDT regimen.</p><p>Our studies support the use of an immune-enhancing PDT regimen as an adjuvant treatment that, when used in conjunction with therapies that inhibit or do not enhance immunity, has the potential to augment anti-tumor immunity. Recent studies have shown that PDT is an effective adjuvant therapy to surgery that increases the probability of long-term local disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Friedberg and colleagues have demonstrated prolonged survival in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with radical pleurectomy and intraoperative PDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] that the authors attribute in part to the immune effects of PDT.</p><p>In summary, we have identified an anti-tumor combination PDT treatment regimen that controls primary and metastatic tumor growth and enhances anti-tumor immunity. The combination therapy consists of treatment with an immune-enhancing PDT regimen followed 10&#x000a0;days later by treatment with a tumor growth-controlling treatment regimen. Treatment of both colon and mammary carcinomas showed similar host responses, and the host responses were independent of the photosensitizer used.
