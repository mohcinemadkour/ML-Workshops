The effect of rifampin-induced induction of P-gp and CYP3A4/5 on transport and metabolism of edoxaban through the CYP3A4/5 pathway was investigated in a single-dose edoxaban study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a phase 1, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, single-sequence drug interaction study in healthy adults. All subjects received a single oral 60&#x000a0;mg edoxaban dose in period 1, and 7 days of 600&#x000a0;mg rifampin (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;300&#x000a0;mg capsules once daily) with a single oral edoxaban 60&#x000a0;mg dose administered concomitantly on day 7 in period 2. A 6-day washout period separated the treatments. Plasma concentrations of edoxaban and its metabolites M4 and M6 were measured, and limited assessments of pharmacodynamic markers of coagulation were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 34 healthy subjects were enrolled; 32 completed the study. Coadministration of rifampin with edoxaban decreased edoxaban exposure but increased active metabolite exposure. Rifampin increased apparent oral clearance of edoxaban by 33&#x000a0;% and decreased its half-life by 50&#x000a0;%. Anticoagulant effects based on the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with and without rifampin at early time points were maintained to a greater-than-expected degree than with edoxaban exposure alone, presumably because of an increased contribution from the active metabolites. Edoxaban was well tolerated in this healthy adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rifampin reduced exposure to edoxaban while increasing exposure to its active metabolites M4 and M6.

Oral administration of edoxaban results in peak plasma concentrations within 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Edoxaban undergoes limited metabolism through phase 1 and phase 2 enzymes. Phase 1 metabolism is predominantly mediated by carboxylesterase-1 (CES-1), with a lesser contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CES-1 mediates formation of human-specific metabolite M4, while CYP3A4/5 mediates formation of M6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Both are active metabolites with anticoagulant activity similar to that of the parent drug (data on file). However, because of low abundance (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;% for each) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], these metabolites are not expected to contribute significantly to total anticoagulant activity in normal circumstances. Edoxaban is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and M4 is a substrate for uptake transporter organic anion&#x02013;transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies demonstrated increased exposure to edoxaban when it was coadministered with P-gp inhibitors such as quinidine, verapamil and dronedarone (increases of 77, 53 and 85&#x000a0;%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Interactions involving transporters may affect drug or metabolite exposure and safety profiles in various tissues. Thus, the US Food and Drug Administration recommends evaluation of the effects of transporter-based drug interactions on absorption and disposition of investigational drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4/5 and P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rifampin is also an inhibitor of OATP1B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which is involved in the transport of the active metabolite M4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This drug interaction study evaluated the effect of multiple doses of rifampin on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of edoxaban and its active metabolites M4 and M6. A limited assessment of the anticoagulatory effect was included at 2, 4 and 24&#x000a0;h after edoxaban dosing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Objectives</title><p>This was a phase 1, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, fixed-sequence study conducted at a single centre. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of rifampin on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of edoxaban when it was coadministered with rifampin. Plasma concentrations of edoxaban and its active metabolites M4 and M6, and the pharmacodynamic markers prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured. This study was nonrandomized because of the potential carryover effects of CYP and P-gp induction by rifampin.</p><p>During period 1, all subjects received a single oral 60&#x000a0;mg edoxaban dose on day 1. During period 2, all subjects received once-daily rifampin 600 mg (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;300 mg Rifadin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> capsules; Sanofi Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) on days 1 through 7, along with a single oral dose of edoxaban 60 mg administered concomitantly on day 7. There was a 6-day washout between treatment periods. All treatments were administered following an overnight 10-h fast, and food intake was prohibited for an additional 2 or 4&#x000a0;h following administration of rifampin or edoxaban, respectively. Edoxaban 60 mg was selected because it was the primary therapeutic dose used in phase 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is well tolerated in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A single rifampin 600&#x000a0;mg dose is the highest recommended dose for treatment of tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The study was approved by the Celerion (formerly MDS Pharma Services) Institutional Review Board (Lincoln, NE, USA) and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation consolidated Guideline E6 for Good Clinical Practice.

These values were fairly consistent with historical values for rifampin administered as 600 mg daily for 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The mean baseline PT and aPTT values were similar for both treatments. The PT and aPTT values at 2 and 4&#x000a0;h were minimally different with and without rifampin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Coadministration of rifampin and edoxaban resulted in minimal changes (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;%) from the baseline PT and aPTT values, compared with administration of edoxaban alone. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as only early anticoagulatory effects were assessed.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Pharmacodynamic effects of edoxaban with and without rifampin on (<bold>a</bold>) the mean prothrombin time and (<bold>b</bold>) the mean activated partial thromboplastin time.

All AEs were mild in intensity. The most common AE was chromaturia (in 32 subjects), a known effect associated with rifampin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The majority of AEs occurred during edoxaban and rifampin coadministration (33 subjects) and were deemed by the investigator to be related to rifampin. Five subjects reported AEs when edoxaban was administered alone. Two AEs were considered related to edoxaban treatment and included headache (reported by one subject) and gingival bleeding (reported by one subject); both events were mild and resolved without treatment. One subject experienced diarrhoea, which was judged to be related to both rifampin and edoxaban. No serious AEs occurred during this study. One subject discontinued participation in the study because of a transient elevation in serum creatinine (21&#x000a0;% above baseline), which was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to the study medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These results suggest that the effect of rifampin on edoxaban was not only to reduce oral bioavailability and increase excretion through potential induction of P-gp, but also to increase its metabolism to form the metabolite M6 through CYP3A4/5. The increase in M4 is likely due to the inhibitory effect of rifampin on OATP1B1, as well as potential induction of CES-1 through upregulation of the pregnane X receptor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The exact effects of rifampin on the disposition of the metabolite M4 are not discernible from this study alone and require further studies (e.g. single-dose versus multiple-dose rifampin coadministered with intravenous and oral edoxaban) to better elucidate OATP1B1 inhibitory effects from enzyme/transporter induction effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of the study were that the mechanism of the increase in metabolite exposure could not be further elucidated. The administration of edoxaban with a single dose of rifampin may have characterized the effect of rifampin on the inhibition of transporters such as P-gp and OATP1B1. Administration of intravenous edoxaban with and without rifampin may have differentiated the prehepatic versus hepatic effects of rifampin on parent and metabolite exposure. Finally, urine concentrations of edoxaban were not measured. Since renal clearance represents approximately 50&#x000a0;% of the total clearance of edoxaban, the impact of rifampin on transporters in renal clearance were not characterized.</p><p>These results demonstrate a drug interaction of edoxaban and its metabolites with rifampin. Induction of both P-gp and CYP3A4/5 by rifampin explains the decreased exposure to edoxaban and the increased exposure to M6 (a metabolite formed via CYP3A4/5). Dosing recommendations in the US prescribing information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] suggest that concomitant use of edoxaban with rifampin should be avoided because of decreased edoxaban exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rifampin significantly decreased exposure to edoxaban and increased exposure to its active metabolites.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>At the time of writing, Dolly A.
