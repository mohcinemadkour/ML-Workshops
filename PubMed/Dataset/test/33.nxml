An important requirement is that such cell samples are handled and analyzed in a comparable fashion to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We performed a proof-of-principle study to show that retrovirally TCR-transduced T cells spiked at defined numbers in autologous PBMC can be used as standard samples for HLA/peptide multimer staining. NY-ESO-1<sub>157&#x02013;165</sub>-specific, TCR-transduced CD8+ T cell batches were successfully generated from PBMC of several HLA-A*0201 healthy donors, purified by magnetic cell sorting on the basis of HLA tetramer (TM) staining and expanded with specific antigen in vitro. When subsequently spiked into autologous PBMC, the detection of these CD3+CD8+TM+ T cells was highly accurate with a mean accuracy of 91.6&#x000a0;%. The standard cells can be preserved for a substantial period of time in liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, TM staining of fresh and cryopreserved standard samples diluted at decreasing concentrations into autologous cryopreserved unspiked PBMC revealed that the spiked CD3+CD8+TM+ T cells could be accurately detected at all dilutions in a linear fashion with a goodness-of-fit of over 0.99 at a frequency of at least 0.02&#x000a0;% among the CD3+CD8+ T cell population. Notably, the CD3+CD8+TM+ cells of the standard samples were located exactly within the gates used to analyze patient samples and displayed a similar scatter pattern. The performance of the cryopreserved standard samples in the hands of 5 external investigators was good with an inter-laboratory variation of 32.9&#x000a0;% and the doubtless identification of one outlier.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00262-012-1351-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Immunomonitoring</kwd><kwd>HLA/peptide multimer staining</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Assay controls</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>To evaluate immunotherapies for cancer, it is needed to show the specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect based on its expected mechanism of action. The ultimate measurement of an immunotherapeutic drug is an objective clinical response, but other measurements of its biological activity using a suitable quantitative biological assay that is linked to the relevant biological properties are highly appropriate during the developmental phase. The biological assay must be standardized at the initial phase and according to regulatory guidelines needs to be validated prior to phase III trials if developed as companion diagnostics. Assay validation can be supported by the identification and/or development of reference materials as these reagents are essential for assay calibration, validation and quality control over a period of time. For T cell-based immunotherapies, therefore, the validation of assays that quantify antigen-specific T cell responses is critically dependent on reference samples that contain measurable numbers of antigen-specific T cells. Unfortunately, the availability of such samples is limited. Moreover, lack of a clearly defined number of T cells specific for a defined antigen within each aliquot hampers the assessment of the accuracy of assays applied. Currently, information on the existing frequency of antigen-specific T cells in cell samples is derived from pre-testing in central laboratories or by consensus (i.e., the average frequency as determined by multiple laboratories in inter-laboratory, proficiency panel projects), and this can only serve as an approximation of the real number of antigen-specific cells present in a given sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; especially, in the field of cancer immunotherapy, an estimation of frequency may fail to reveal subtle aspects of assay protocols that allow the accurate detection of tumor-specific T cells at the generally low frequencies reported in patients. One of the broadly applied methods to measure and quantify tumor-specific T cells is the use of HLA tetramers (HLA&#x02013;TM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to generate reference material, it has been proposed to spike PBMC with previously isolated T cell clones (TCC) with known reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, this is not a robust option because TCC have a limited life span and the production of quality standard samples requires huge expansions from a single TCC, meaning that new TCC (of constant quality) should be generated constantly. To circumvent this problem, others have tried to use T cell receptor (TCR)-transduced cell lines (e.g., K562). However, the outcome of several proficiency panels such as those run by the Immunoguiding Program of the Cancer Immunotherapy Association (CIP) showed that the gating strategy followed to detect antigen-specific T cells has a major impact on the outcome of T cell assays utilizing the flow cytometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we argued that appropriate in-house reference material should not only be handled and tested, but also analyzed in a comparable fashion to materials from clinical trials. Here, we propose to use TCR-transduced T cells spiked into autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to overcome these problems. In this proof-of-principle study, we show that such standard samples can stably be preserved in liquid nitrogen before they are used to generate standard curves in which the detection of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by HLA&#x02013;TM staining is highly accurate and follows a linear function with high correlations of coefficiency. Using overlay plots, the HLA&#x02013;TM-positive events observed in the scatter plots of the standard sample are detected exactly within the area as the PBMC from patients. For individual laboratories, TCR-transduced T cells spiked into autologous PBMC may form a valuable tool to increase the accuracy of the measurements of immune responses and for performing periodic quality controls of assays. In addition, they can be used to compare the measurements of different laboratories within proficiency panels, and as such, they can be used to optimize and standardize immunomonitoring assays. Moreover, they offer the possibility to fully compare the results of one laboratory to another.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The authors acknowledge the concept of the minimal information about T cell assays (MIATA) framework which was recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

To obtain a higher number of antigen-specific TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells, the freshly transduced T cell fractions were subjected to one cycle of antigen-specific expansion using autologous monocytes pulsed with the NY-ESO-1<sub>157&#x02013;165</sub> peptide.

These results show that the NY-ESO-1-specific TCR can be successfully introduced into PBMC of healthy donors, that the transgenic TCR is constitutively expressed at a high level by the TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells, and that these TCR-positive T cell fractions can be isolated and expanded reproducibly for further use.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Generation of standard samples.

Viable PBMC was gated based on forward and side scatter. The TCR-transduced T cells were spiked as a percentage of the total PBMC and not only T cells; therefore, we analyzed the percentage of CD45+ NY-ESO-1 TM+ cells as the detected percentage should be close to the spiked percentage of cells. Furthermore, the CD3+CD8+TM+ cells were analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The exact percentage of expected NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T cells spiked into CD45+ autologous PBMC was calculated by multiplying the measured percentage of HLA&#x02013;TM-positive TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells (94.2&#x000a0;%) with the percentage of spiked cells (0.25&#x000a0;%), resulting in an expected percentage of 0.24&#x000a0;% of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells within the total (CD45+) PBMC population. The percentage of detected TM+ cells in the CD45 population in the spiked PBMC sample was 0.237&#x000a0;% CD45+TM+ cells and in the non-spiked PBMC sample 0.013&#x000a0;%. Subtraction of this background indicates that the exact percentage of detected spiked cells was 0.224&#x000a0;%, which was close to what was expected. Similarly, the percentage of expected TM+ spiked CD8+ T cells among the CD3+CD8+ cell population in PBMC was calculated to be 0.93&#x000a0;% of TM+CD3+CD8+ T cells. For this, the percentage of viable cells was divided by the percentage of cells in the CD3+CD8+ gate and multiplied by the expected percentage of spiked cells among the CD45+ population (94.8&#x000a0;% live cells/24.3&#x000a0;% CD3+CD8+ cells&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.24&#x000a0;% CD45+ HLA&#x02013;TM+ cells&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.93&#x000a0;%).

In order to determine the stability of the standard samples when frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen, the samples were stored and aliquots of the cryopreserved samples were subsequently thawed and analyzed at different time points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

The batch was spiked in a range of 0.25&#x02013;0.015&#x000a0;% cells into autologous PBMC.

Therefore, PBMC spiked with very low to high frequencies of TCR-transduced CD8+TM+ T cells were cryopreserved and thawed after 4&#x000a0;weeks of storage. Analysis of these samples revealed a loss of CD3+CD8+TM+ T cells that was specifically noticeable in the samples spiked with low frequencies of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells and reflected by a failure to detect low-frequency T cells and a loss of the linearity of detection at the lower frequency range. The lowest accurate measurement of TM+ cells in the CD45 population increased to 0.055&#x000a0;% and that of TM+ cells in the CD3+CD8+ population to 0.20&#x000a0;% (data not shown). Therefore, an alternative approach was chosen in which a cryopreserved standard sample containing a relatively high concentration (0.25&#x000a0;%) of TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells was thawed and diluted at decreasing concentrations into autologous cryopreserved unspiked PBMC. Analysis of the percentage of TM+ cells in these samples showed that an increase in the percentage of TM+ cells as compared to the unspiked sample could be detected at all dilutions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Plots of the detected (minus background of unspiked sample) and expected percentages of TM+ cells in either CD45+ cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) or CD3+CD8+ T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f) revealed strong linearity with a goodness-of-fit of over 0.99 and the possibility to accurately detect antigen-specific (TCR-transduced) T cells at a frequency of &#x0003e;0.004&#x000a0;% among the CD45+ and at a frequency of &#x0003e;0.02&#x000a0;% in the CD3+CD8+ cell population. This shows that cryopreserved standard samples when diluted in unspiked autologous PBMC directly before analysis can be used to prepare a standard curve enabling a controlled detection of low-frequency antigen-specific cells in patients.</p><p>We then put this to the test and prepared a standard curve from a cryopreserved standard cell sample as well as tested the PBMC of a number of melanoma patients for the presence of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells by TM staining and flow cytometry. The tumors of patients 2, 3 and 5&#x02013;7 were found to be NY-ESO-1 positive by mRNA (not shown). The standard curve ranged from an expected 0.025&#x02013;0.40&#x000a0;% of TM+ cells within the CD3+CD8+ T cell population. The expected percentages of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells across the whole range of low to high frequencies were accurately detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Again, a clear linear relationship existed between the detected and expected populations of CD3+CD8+TM+ T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Of note, a twofold increase in immune activity over background often is used to define a positive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; when we plotted the percentages of observed TM+ cells among the CD3+CD8+ T cell population without subtraction of background versus the expected population of CD8+ T cells (Online Resource 2), the data started to become linear at twice the background. Unfortunately, none of the patients displayed a response that exceeded the number of TM-positive events in our lowest standard cell control. We then back-gated the TM-positive events in the control sample, and by overlaying the plots, we showed that the CD3+CD8+TM+ T cells were located exactly within the gates used to analyze patient PBMC samples. In addition, the few HLA&#x02013;TM+ events in the patient samples and the abundantly present HLA&#x02013;TM-positive events in the control sample showed the same scatter pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Analysis of standard samples is not different from patient samples.

Our results show that the method to generate standard samples by retroviral transduction of PBMC followed by HLA tetramer&#x02013;specific isolation and antigen-specific expansion reproducibly results in high-quality standard samples that can be made with a standard PBMC batch (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When spiked into autologous PBMC, the activated TCR-transduced T cells appear at the exact region (i.e., gates) where one would expect to find resting and activated antigen-specific T cells in patient PBMC samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), allowing researchers to use the same gating strategy for the standard and test samples during analysis. Whereas it was previously not possible to establish the accuracy of HLA multimer analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the measurement of spiked samples and standard curves with TCR-transduced T cells in autologous PBMC showed that the detected frequencies of antigen-specific T cells were accurate (Online Resource 1) and well within the range of what is considered to be an acceptable accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, the detection of spiked TM+ cells followed a linear function with a high correlation coefficient across all the high to very low tested frequencies, indicating that even small increases in the percentage of TM+ can be correctly detected (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The intra-assay precision was also acceptable with CV&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;% as determined by the measurement of samples that were stored for the short and long term in liquid nitrogen before analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, our standard curve showed that the lower limit of accurate detection is 0.02&#x000a0;% of CD8+ T cells, which is within the range of limits of detection (0.01&#x02013;0.04&#x000a0;%) established by others using HLA tetramers for HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells epitopes in gp100, MART, HIV, CMV and influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>We performed a small proficiency panel with our standard samples. The laboratories involved had previously participated in the CIP proficiency panels and were harmonized with respect to HLA multimer analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The current proficiency panel revealed the capacity of harmonized laboratories to detect a fixed number of antigen-specific T cells with low variation. It also showed that this type of standard samples can be used to identify true outliers, as the frequency of the antigen-specific cells is known. Thus, the standard sample resolves a recurrent discussion point accompanying the evaluation of the outcomes of proficiency panels to date.</p><p>Taken together, these features qualify the retrovirally TCR-transduced T cells spiked into autologous PBMC as excellent standard samples that may be used: (a) to validate one&#x02019;s HLA/peptide multimer assay, (b) as control sample for the analysis of samples at different time points or laboratories within one or multiple trial(s), (c) to identify protocol parameters and the outcome of measurements and (d) to identify protocols/laboratories with a true high or low performance. Provided that the cloned TCRs are available for transduction, the cost to generate standard samples is low, certainly when compared to the costs associated with immunomonitoring or the general costs of a clinical trial. Notably, as these standard samples consist of retrovirally transduced TCR-expressing T cells spiked back into autologous healthy donor PBMC, they form a widely applicable tool. The downside is that use of retroviral TCR transduction requires specialized laboratories to produce standard samples. Although after purification and expansion the cells are free of infectious virus, not all institutes may allow the manipulation of such cells in their flow cytometry facilities or in standard laboratories despite fixation with paraformaldehyde. Furthermore, the organization of proficiency panels may be prohibitively costly when these samples are sent to different countries. A solution to this would be the use of modified RNA as format for delivery of TCR chains to primary lymphocytes, which we are currently exploring, as it may offer a simple, virus-free and scalable process for the manufacturing of reference samples in peripheral laboratories. Overall, our study opens the possibility to engineer standard samples that can be used in a similar fashion as for patient samples to accurately measure the frequency of antigen-specific T cells by
