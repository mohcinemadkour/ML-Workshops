The level of pain relief achieved with opioid analgesics varies from patient to patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and many patients (approximately 10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;%) with cancer-related pain do not achieve adequate analgesia with opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, side effects are common in patients receiving long-term opioid treatment for chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., constipation, nausea, and vomiting) are particularly burdensome for patients with cancer-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Opioids induce nausea, vomiting, and constipation in a high percentage of patients taking opioid analgesics for cancer pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and may exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the underlying disease or treatment. Opioid switching is a proven approach for reducing intolerable side effects that has also been shown to be effective at improving analgesia for more than 50&#x000a0;% of patients with a poor response to an initial opioid analgesic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Japanese Society of Palliative Medicine recommends switching the type of opioid used in patients with pain that is inadequately controlled or who experience intolerable side effects (particularly nausea and vomiting) when taking a particular opioid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Improvements in pain intensity and tolerability have been observed following rotation from one opioid analgesic to another in multiple studies in Japanese patients with cancer pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic with two mechanisms of action: &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The gastrointestinal tolerability of tapentadol extended release (ER) has been shown to be better than that of equianalgesic doses of oxycodone controlled release (CR) and morphine CR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The effectiveness and safety of tapentadol ER for the management of moderate to severe, chronic tumor&#x02013;related pain have been demonstrated in phase&#x000a0;III clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and in exploratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and non-interventional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] studies. In a phase&#x000a0;III study in patients with moderate to severe, chronic tumor&#x02013;related pain, tapentadol ER (100&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg twice daily) was shown to provide non-inferior effectiveness to that of morphine sulfate CR (40&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg twice daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a separate phase&#x000a0;III study in opioid-naive Japanese patients experiencing cancer pain, the analgesic effectiveness of tapentadol ER (25&#x02013;200&#x000a0;mg twice daily) was shown to be non-inferior to that of oxycodone HCl CR (5&#x02013;40&#x000a0;mg twice daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Given its improved tolerability relative to opioid analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], tapentadol ER could be considered as a first option for patients who need opioid treatment to control their pain. For patients who are taking another strong opioid analgesic and experience intolerable opioid-induced side effects, it may be necessary to switch directly from the prior opioid to tapentadol ER to relieve those side effects.</p><p>In this 8-week, randomized, open-label phase&#x000a0;III study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01309386) conducted in Japan, the effectiveness of tapentadol ER (50&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg twice daily) in safely converting patients from previous around-the-clock strong opioid therapy without loss of previous pain control was evaluated in patients with moderate to severe, chronic malignant tumor&#x02013;related cancer pain that had been controlled by prior opioid therapy.

Patients continued taking the same doses of their previous around-the-clock daily opioid analgesics throughout the screening period. Eligible patients with a mean pain intensity score &#x0003c;4 during the 3&#x000a0;days prior to randomization were then randomized (1:1) to receive twice-daily treatment with tapentadol ER or morphine SR (as a reference for assay sensitivity) for 8&#x000a0;weeks. Randomization was stratified by prior opioid treatment to ensure that the treatment assignment was balanced. Morphine SR served as a reference for assay sensitivity, not as an active comparator, to validate the results observed with tapentadol ER. Starting doses of study drug were calculated based on the previous opioid analgesic dose (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Patients rated their average pain intensity over the previous 24&#x000a0;h once daily on an 11-point NRS throughout the study. The primary effectiveness endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients who maintained pain control during the first week of the open-label treatment period. Pain control was defined as having a change from baseline in the mean 24-h pain intensity score (11-point NRS) of less than +1.5 and using no more than two doses of rescue medication per day for any 3 consecutive days during the first week. Patients were enrolled in the study only if their pain was well-controlled [i.e., pain intensity (NRS) score &#x0003c;4] on their previous opioid therapy; thus, pain was considered to be controlled on study treatment only if patients experienced minimal changes in pain intensity after conversion from prior therapy.</p><p>Secondary effectiveness endpoints included average weekly pain intensity scores (11-point NRS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) ratings, and rescue medication use. The PGIC is a validated measure of global improvement with treatment for chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Morphine SR was used to evaluate assay sensitivity in this study, and the same number of patients were to be enrolled to receive morphine SR treatment as in the tapentadol ER group, bringing the total number of subjects to approximately 100.

Patients who discontinued after &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;days of treatment or who did not have any available 24-h pain intensity scores (11-point NRS) for 3 consecutive days during the first week of treatment were considered to have not maintained pain control.

The incidence of TEAEs was also analyzed by previous opioid treatment, sex, and age group (&#x0003c;65 and &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age).</p><p>In the current study, morphine SR served as a reference for assay sensitivity, not as an active comparator, so no formal comparisons of the effectiveness results for tapentadol ER and morphine SR were performed. For that reason, effectiveness data for the patients in the tapentadol ER and morphine SR groups are presented separately; sensitivity analyses (i.e., effectiveness results for morphine SR) are included in the Electronic Supplementary Material. Patient disposition and demographic data are presented together to show that the population analyzed for effectiveness (the tapentadol ER group) was comparable with the population analyzed for assay sensitivity (the morphine SR group). Safety and tolerability data for both treatment groups are presented together to allow for informal comparisons of the tolerability of tapentadol ER with that of an opioid analgesic commonly used for cancer pain management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was conducted from 23&#x000a0;August 2010 to 17&#x000a0;January 2012.

The intention of the current study was to show under controlled experimental conditions that patients with stable pain control could achieve comparable effectiveness with tapentadol ER, in order to be able to recommend this switch as necessary in practice. Pain control was maintained by 84&#x000a0;% of patients within the first week after switching to tapentadol ER. For the primary effectiveness endpoint, a 7-day period after switching from the previous strong opioid analgesic was considered sufficient to demonstrate pain control because the initial dose of study drug was based on the dose of the previous opioid, which had provided adequate pain control [as indicated by a pain intensity (NRS) score &#x0003c;4]. Although pain control was consistent following direct conversion from prior opioid therapy to tapentadol ER, effectiveness in the tapentadol ER group further improved over time after Week&#x000a0;1; this further improvement indicates that the best effectiveness was obtained after the initial conversion when patients were individually titrated to their optimal dose, balancing effectiveness and tolerability. The sensitivity of effectiveness analyses in the current study were validated based on the positive results achieved with morphine SR; a high percentage of patients (98&#x000a0;%) maintained pain control during the first week with morphine SR. Morphine SR was chosen as the reference for assay sensitivity in this study because it is generally considered to be the standard of care for the management of moderate to severe cancer pain requiring a strong opioid and has been used extensively in cancer pain studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Because this study included patients who were previously on strong opioid analgesics (including morphine SR), some patients who were previously taking morphine SR would have been randomized to the same treatment (morphine SR) during open-label treatment, which may have introduced bias in favor of the morphine SR group; in fact, 24&#x000a0;% of patients in the morphine SR group were pretreated with morphine SR prior to conversion. For that reason, direct comparisons of effectiveness between the tapentadol ER group, in which all patients had previously received other strong opioids (morphine SR, oxycodone CR, or transdermal fentanyl), and the morphine SR treatment group may not have yielded accurate results for interpretation of conversion in this group.</p><p>PGIC outcomes supported the results of the primary effectiveness analysis in the tapentadol ER group; the percentage of patients reporting an improvement or no change in their overall condition on the PGIC increased over the course of the 8-week treatment period. Only patients with adequate pain control on their previous opioid analgesic were included in this study, so major improvements were not expected in patients&#x02019; overall condition. With tapentadol ER, the majority of patients experienced no change or a minimal improvement; this is consistent with the inclusion of a population with well-controlled pain on their previous analgesic regimen, but also suggests that the majority of patients treated with tapentadol ER either maintained or experienced improvements in their pain control and overall condition.</p><p>In the current study, tapentadol ER was generally well-tolerated and there were no unexpected safety findings. The incidence of gastrointestinal TEAEs (particularly vomiting and constipation), drug-related AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation was lower with tapentadol ER than with morphine SR. Additionally, the differences observed in this study between tapentadol ER and morphine SR in gastrointestinal tolerability and in AEs leading to discontinuation were comparable with differences seen between tapentadol and oxycodone in other phase&#x000a0;III studies in acute and chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The improvement in gastrointestinal side effects with tapentadol ER may be of particular clinical relevance because gastrointestinal side effects often lead patients to discontinue therapy, resulting in disruption of pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>The conversion ratio used in the current study to determine starting doses of tapentadol ER and morphine SR was based on prior estimates of the equianalgesic ratio of tapentadol ER to oxycodone CR (~5:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and of the equianalgesic ratio between oxycodone CR, morphine SR, and a fentanyl transdermal system (2:3:0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The tapentadol ER to morphine SR conversion ratio in the current study (3.3:1) was in keeping with previously reported estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There is generally a range of estimates of dose conversion ratios for opioid analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the conversion ratios used in the current study were at the lower end of those ranges. This type of conservative approach may be associated with a better response to opioid treatment and a more favorable tolerability profile than a more aggressive treatment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The daily doses of tapentadol ER used in the current study were relatively low. For tapentadol ER, the mean average TDD used in the current study was 173.5&#x000a0;mg; by comparison, the mean average TDD of tapentadol ER used in previous studies in patients with chronic osteoarthritis or low back pain ranged from 232.7 to 326.7&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The difference in TDDs between the current study and those previous studies may have been related to differences in study populations. The previous studies included largely North American and European patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], while the current study included exclusively Japanese patients. In general, Japanese patients require lower doses of opioid-type analgesics to control their cancer pain than Western patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>This study may be associated with some inherent limitations, including the fact that the study is not double-blind. The open-label design of this first conversion study with tapentadol ER in Japanese patients was intended to ensure the safety of study participants and to allow proper dosing decisions to be made for these patients. In addition, some patients randomized to treatment in the morphine SR group had previously been taking morphine SR; results for those patients, who received continuous treatment with a single opioid may have differed from results for patients who switched from a different previous opioid to morphine SR or tapentadol ER. The positive results achieved in the current study, which showed that tapentadol ER was safe and effective for chronic cancer pain management after direct conversion from WHO Step&#x000a0;III opioids, were congruous with those of previous studies showing safe and effective pain relief with tapentadol ER after direct conversion from WHO Step&#x000a0;III opioids in patients with different types of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Overall, results of this study indicate that patients whose moderate to severe, cancer-related pain was previously well-controlled with morphine SR, oxycodone CR, or transdermal fentanyl were safely converted to tapentadol ER (50&#x02013;250&#x000a0;mg twice daily) with no loss of pain control. The majority of patients had maintained pain control within 1&#x000a0;week of conversion to tapentadol ER, indicating that direct conversion from prior strong opioid therapy to tapentadol ER was successful. In addition, tapentadol ER had a better gastrointestinal tolerability profile than morphine SR; a notable difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs between tapentadol ER and morphine SR was observed after only 1&#x000a0;week of treatment. The favorable tolerability profile of tapentadol ER may improve compliance in patients with chronic cancer-related pain, resulting in more consistent pain relief and better patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40261_2014_204_MOESM1_ESM.doc"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOC 27&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01309386.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC, funded this study.
