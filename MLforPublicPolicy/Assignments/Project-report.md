Please submit the project report and the github repo for the code here.

The final project report should follow the format for a paper that you might submit to a conference. You should keep is under 8 pages and cover the following topics:

1. Background and Introduction: This section motivates the problem, explains why it's important, why should we care, and the potential impact if it's solved.

2. Related work: What's been done before in this area and why your work is different.

3. Problem formulation and Overview of your solution

4. Data Description

5. Details of your solution: methods, tools, analysis you did, models, features

6. Evaluation: results, plots (for example precision recall curves, other types of results)

7. Discussion of the results: what did you learn from looking at the results about the data, problem, and solution.

8. Policy Recommendations based on your analysis/models

9. Limitations, caveats, future work to improve on what you've done.


The Github repo should be documented in two ways:

1. Instructions on the structure of the repository, what files are there, and how one should run your code (installing any packages for example)

2. The relevant code files should be documented.
