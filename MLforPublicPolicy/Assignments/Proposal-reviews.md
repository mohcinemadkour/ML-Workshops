# Proposal Reviews

Each of you will get an email from me with a list of 3 proposals (and the download URLS) you should review. 
The assignment is to read the proposals and submit reviews for them at https://datascience.wufoo.com/forms/ppv3sac0ddp7vs/

You should read the review form first to get an idea of what I'm looking for and then read the proposals. 
Don't spend too much time on this - I'm expecting 15-20 minutes per proposal (so under 1 hour for the 3 proposals).
