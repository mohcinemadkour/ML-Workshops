Several of you have asked me about what types of things you should typically do in the data exploration phase of a project. We haven't covered that topic much, not because it's not important but because it's not the focus of this class. We will cover a little more in unsupervised learning as a way to do data exploration. It's very important and critical to the overall process. Here are some things you want to do during data exploration:

1. distributions of different variables
2. correlations between variables - you can do a correlation matrix and turn it into a heatmap
3. changes and trends over time - how does the data and the entities in the data change over time
4. missing values - are there lots of missing values? is there any pattern there?
5. looking at outliers - this can be done using clustering (that we'll cover later) but also using other methods by plotting distributions.
6. cross-tabs (if you're looking at multiple classes/labels), describing how the positive and negative classes are different without doing any machine learning.
